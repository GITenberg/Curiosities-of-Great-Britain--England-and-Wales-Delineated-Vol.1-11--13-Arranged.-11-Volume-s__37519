<p>[A] ABBERBURY, or Alberbury, a parish and township, partly in the
hundreds of Cawrse and Deythur, in the county of Montgomery, and
partly in that of Ford, in the county of Salop. Warine, sheriff of this
county in the reign of Henry I., founded an abbey for black monks, a
cell to Guardmont, in Limosin, which, at the suppression of alien priories
was bestowed by Henry VI. upon the college founded by Archbishop
Chiechley. Benthall, Eyton, Rowton, Amaston, and Wollaston, are
all townships of this parish. At Glyn, in this parish, is the celebrated


<span class="sidenote">Old Parr's
cottage and
birth-place,
who lived in
the reigns of
ten kings
and queens.</span>


Old Parr's cottage, which has undergone but little alteration since his
time; it is timber-framed, rare, and picturesque, within view of Rodney's
Pillar on Bredden Hill, in Montgomeryshire. In Wollaston Chapel is a
brass plate, with his portrait thus inscribed: "The old, old, very
old man, Thomas Parr, was born at the Glyn, in the township of
Wennington, within the chapelry of Great Wollaston, and parish of
Alberbury, in the county of Salop, in 1483. He lived in the reigns of
ten kings and queens of England, viz. King Edward IV., King Edward
V., King Richard III., King Henry VII., King Henry VIII., King
Edward VI., Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, King James I., and
Charles I.; he died in London, (sixteen years after his presentation to

<p>[B] ABBEY-HOLM is a small town in the ward of Allerdale. The
original consequence of this little town was derived from an abbey of
Cistercian monks, founded here, about the twelfth century, by Henry I.
of England, as the crown rolls imply. Its benefactors were many in
number, and by the magnificent grants and privileges with which it was
endowed, it acquired so much importance, that during the reigns of
Edward I. and II. its abbots, though not mitred, were frequently
summoned to sit in parliament. The abbey was pillaged and burnt
during the incursion of Robert Bruce, but afterwards rebuilt with great
magnificence; few vestiges, however, of its monastic buildings now
remain. From the ruins the Parochial Chapel was formed, and there
yet stands a part of the church in its original form. During the reign
of Henry VIII. the abbey was chiefly dilapidated; the church continued
in good condition till the year 1600, when the steeple, one hundred
and fourteen feet high, suddenly fell down, and by its fall destroyed
great part of the chancel. Its total ruin was nearly accomplished by an
accidental fire five years afterwards. This fire took place on April 18,


<span class="sidenote">The Abbey
destroyed by the accidental
firing of
a daw's nest.</span>


1604, and was occasioned by a servant carrying a live coal into the
roof of the church, to search for an iron chisel; the boisterous wind blew
the coal out of his hand into a daw's nest, by which the whole was
ignited, and within less than three hours it consumed both the body of
the chancel and the whole church, except the south side of the low
church, which was saved by means of a stone vault. Almost due-west
from Abbey-Holm, in a strong situation near the sea coast, are some
remains of Wulstey Castle, a fortress, which was erected by the
abbots to secure their treasures, books, and charters from the sudden
depredations of the Scots. "In this castle," observes Camden, "tradition
reports, that the magic works of Sir Michael Scot (or Scotus),


<span class="sidenote">Michael
Scot, the
magician.</span>


were preserved, till they were mouldering into dust. He professed a
religious life here about the year 1290, and became so versed in the
mathematics, and other abstruse sciences, that he obtained the character
of a magician, and was believed, in that credulous age, to have performed
many miracles." The story of Michael Scot forms a beautiful
episode in Scott's "Lay of the Last Minstrel," the notes to which
furnish some curious information respecting that extraordinary personage.
Sir Michael Scot, of Balwearie, we are told, flourished during
the thirteenth century, and was one of the ambassadors sent to bring
the Maid of Norway to Scotland, upon the death of Alexander III.


<span class="sidenote">Scottish
legends.</span>


His memory survives in many a legend; and in the south of Scotland,
any work of great labour and antiquity is ascribed either to the agency
of auld Michael, of Sir William Wallace, or the devil. The following
are amongst the current traditions concerning Michael Scot:&mdash;He was
chosen, it is said, to go upon an embassy, to obtain from the King of
France satisfaction for certain piracies committed by his subjects upon
those of Scotland. Instead of preparing a new equipage and splendid
retinue, he evoked a fiend in the shape of a huge black horse, mounted


<span class="sidenote">The fiend
horse.</span>


upon his back, and forced him to fly through the air towards France.
When he arrived at Paris, he tied his horse to the gate of the palace,
and boldly delivered his message. An ambassador with so little of the
pomp and circumstance of diplomacy was not received with much
respect, and the king was about to return a contemptuous refusal to his
demand, when Michael besought him to suspend his resolution till he
had seen his horse stamp three times: the first stamp shook every
steeple in Paris, and caused all the bells to ring; the second threw
down three of the towers of the palace; and the infernal steed had


<span class="sidenote">French
King's concession.</span>


lifted up his hoof to give the third stamp, when the king rather chose to
dismiss Michael, with the most ample concessions, than to stand to the
probable consequences. Another time, it is said that, while residing at
the tower of Oakwood, upon the Ettrick, about three miles above
Selkirk, having heard of the fame of a sorceress, called the Witch of


<span class="sidenote">The witch
of Falsehope.</span>


Falsehope, who lived on the opposite side of the river, Michael went one
morning to put her skill to the test, but was disappointed by her
positively denying any knowledge of the necromantic art. In his discourse
with her, he laid his wand inadvertently on the table which the
hag observing, suddenly snatched it up and struck him with it. Feeling
the force of the charm, he rushed out of the house; but as it had
conferred on him the external appearance of a hare, his servant, who
waited without, hallooed upon the discomfited wizard his own greyhounds,
and pursued him so close, that, in order to obtain a moment's
breathing to reverse the charm, Michael, after a very fatiguing course,
was fain to take refuge in his own common sewer.</p>

<p>[B] ABBOTSBURY consists of a single parish, divided into three
streets, nearly in the form of the letter Y, lying in a valley surrounded
and protected by bold hills near the sea. There is a tradition that this


<span class="sidenote">Tradition of
St. Peter</span>


place was called Abodesbyry by St. Peter himself, in the infancy of Christianity,
but it is more probably supposed to have derived its name from
the magnificent abbey, originally founded here, in the early part of the
eleventh century. The ruins of the abbey (which was once large and
splendid, but is now nearly demolished), consist of a large barn, a


<span class="sidenote">A ruined

stable, supposed to have been the dormitory, a porch which belonged
to the conventual church, the principal entrance, a portion of the walls,
and two buildings conjectured to have been used for domestic purposes.
The barn, which, when entire, was the largest in the county, is now so
dilapidated, that only a part of it can be used. The church, in which
Orcus and his wife, the founders, were buried, is, with the exception
of the porch and a pile of ruins under some neighbouring elms, totally
destroyed; but the numerous chantries and chapels which belonged
to it sufficiently prove its ancient magnificence. On an eminence, at a
short distance from the town, stands a small building called St. Catherine's


<span class="sidenote">St. Catherine's

Chapel, which is supposed to have been erected about the time of
Edward IV., and which from its height and lofty situation, serves both
for a sea and land mark. Abbotsbury Church appears to have been built
a short time before the reformation; the pulpit is pierced by musket
balls, said to have been fired by Cromwell's soldiers, at the officiating
minister, whom, however, they missed. But it is more likely to have
occurred at the time of Sir Anthony Astley Cooper's attack on the
royalists, at the siege of Sir John Strangeway's house, in 1651. About


<span class="sidenote">Wild fowl

a mile to the south-west of Abbotsbury, is the "decoy," where great
quantities of wild fowl are annually taken. But the object which most
engages the attention of strangers, in the neighbourhood of this town,
is the celebrated "swannery," which, not long since, was the property
of the Earl of Ilchester. In the open or broad space of the fleet are
kept six or seven hundred swans, formerly one thousand five hundred,
including hoppers&mdash;a small species of swans, who feed and range, and
return home again.</p>

shape, and is thought by some to have been the Conovium of


<span class="sidenote">The Conovium

the Romans. The annals of this place commence no earlier than with
the history of its castle, which was erected in 1284, by command of
Edward I., as a security against the insurrections of the Welsh. Soon
after its erection, the royal founder was besieged in it, and the garrison
almost reduced by famine to surrender, when they were extricated by
the arrival of a fleet with provision. At the commencement of the civil
wars, it was garrisoned on behalf of the king, by Dr. John Williams,
Archbishop of York. In 1645 he gave the government of the castle
to his nephew, William Hookes. Two years after, Prince Rupert
superseded the Archbishop in the command of North Wales. He endeavoured
to obtain redress from the king, but failed. Enraged at this
injury, he joined Mytton, and assisted in the reduction of the place.
The town was taken by storm, August 15, 1646, but the castle did not


<span class="sidenote">Town taken

surrender till November 10. This fortress remained in tranquillity till a
grant was made of it, by King Charles, to the Earl of Conway and
Kilulta; when he had scarcely obtained possession, before he ordered
an agent to remove the timber, iron, lead, and other materials. It was
held on lease, by Owen Holland, Esq. from the crown, at an annual rent
of six shillings and eightpence, and a dish of fish to Lord Holland, as

suffered material injuries from wind and weather, and is reduced to a
state of rapid decay. The ruins are remarkably picturesque, and very
extensive. The town was surrounded by high massive walls, twelve
feet thick, strengthened at intervals by twenty-four circular and semi-circular
towers; these, with the four principal gateways, remain in tolerable
preservation. There are scarcely any remains of the Cistercian

Abbey, founded by Llewelyn ap Jorwerth, in 1185. The church contains
a few modern monuments, belonging to the family of the Wynnes,
formerly of this place. The font appears ancient; it is composed of black
marble, curiously carved, and supported by a cluster of pilasters, standing
upon a pedestal. In Castle Street is a very old house, called the college,
which has a singular window, decorated with several coats of arms of
the Stanley family. A day school is also kept in an ancient mansion,
called Plas Mawr, situated near the market place, which was erected in
1585, by Robert Wynne, Esq. of Gwyder. The river Conway rises out
of Llyn Conway, at the south extremity of the county, in the mountains
of Penmachno. The ferry is of importance, as it lies upon one of the
great roads from London to Ireland, but is justly considered a dangerous

Day, 1806, the boat conveying the Irish mail coach, was lost, and
all the passengers, including the coachman and guard, were drowned,
except two. At the Ferry-house a noble bay is formed where the tide
enters the river. In this view, indeed, there are all the ingredients of a
sublime and beautiful landscape. Few rivers, in England or Wales,
in so short a course as twenty-nine miles, present so great a variety of
beautiful scenery. Below Luna Hall, the falls of the Conway exhibit

objects. Upon the west side is the abrupt termination of the Snowdon
chain, down the declivities of which, through innumerable chasms,
fissures, and channels, rush the superfluous waters of the lakes above, to
mingle with the parent ocean. The principal employment of the poor,
in this neighbourhood, is gathering the different species of fuci, commonly

called sea-wreck, thrown up by the tide, or growing upon the

the sand, and heat it till it becomes a liquid and forms a cake; when
further baked or burnt it resembles cinders, and is called barilla or impure
fossil alkali; in this state it is sold to manufacturers of soap and glass.</p>

<p>[B] ABEREDWY. This delightful village derived its name from its
situation, near the junction of the River Wye and Edwy. Nothing in
nature can exceed the beauty of the neighbouring scenery. The Edwy
descends through lofty walls of rock; in some places, broken into crags,
which frightfully overhang the abyss. Near the place are the ruins of
a castle, the retreat of the last native Welsh Prince, Llewelyn ap


<span class="sidenote">Ruined
castle&mdash;the
retreat of
Llewelyn,
the last native
Prince of
Wales.</span>


Gruffydd. The object of Llewelyn's journey to Aberedwy was to
consult the chief persons of the district, upon the best means of successfully
opposing the King of England, then invading Wales. On his
arrival he found himself disappointed. Instead of meeting with friends,
he was surrounded by the enemy. Edmund Mortimer and John Gyfford,
acquainted with his route, marched from Herefordshire, with their
troops to meet him. The enemy were numerous&mdash;resistance was in
vain&mdash;Llewelyn withdrew to Builth. The mountains being covered
with snow, he caused the shoes of his horse to be reversed, in order to


<span class="sidenote">His horses
shoes reversed.</span>


baffle pursuit, but the treacherous <i>smith</i> betrayed him.
Llewelyn broke down the bridge of Builth, but was closely followed by the
English forces, who fruitlessly attempted to gain it. Sir Elias Walwyn


<span class="sidenote">Betrayed by
his smith.</span>


crossed the river, with a detachment, about eight miles below, at a
place called Little Tom's Ferry Boat, and coming unexpectedly on the
Welsh army, routed them. Llewelyn himself was attacked and slain,
unarmed, in a narrow valley, not two hundred yards from the scene of
action. Adam Francton, the murderer of Llewelyn, took no notice of


<span class="sidenote">His army
routed, and
himself
slain.</span>


his victim, but joined in the pursuit of the Welsh. Returning with the
view of plundering the slain, he discovered the wounded person was no
other than the Prince of Wales; for on stripping him, he found a letter
in cipher and his privy seal. The brutal Francton, overjoyed that the
Welsh prince had fallen into his hands, cut off his head, and sent


<span class="sidenote">His head

it to the King of England, and thus perished the last native Prince of
Wales.</p>


<p>[C] ABERFORD is situated upon the River Cock, on the great northern
road, on the banks of which river was fought the famous battle of Towton,
in 1461, so called from a village in the vicinity. The town consists of a
long straggling street, in the north of which are the remains of a Norman


<span class="sidenote">Here the famous
battle
of Towton

fortification, called Castle Carey; and the whole is in the line of the
ancient Roman road. This town is curiously situated, as respects township:
the west side is in Aberford-cum-Parlington; the east of the same
end is Lotherton-cum-Aberford, and the north of the river is Aberford
alone.</p>

<p>[D] ABERGAVENNY, (the ancient Gobanium of the Romans,) and its


<span class="sidenote">Gobanium

environs, have strong claims to the traveller's attention. Its castle and
delightful terrace overlook the rich vale of Usk; its church, abounding
in costly sculptured tombs, its beautifully variegated mountains, all
conspire to render this place particularly attractive. This town was
once fortified, and many portions of the work remain, particularly


<span class="sidenote">Tudor's
Gate.</span>


Tudor's Gate. The western entrance is furnished with two portcullises,
and remarkable for the beautifully composed landscape seen through it.
The style of building which forms the remains of this fortress marks
its origin to have been subsequent to the Norman epoch. Excursions
are frequently made to Blaenavon Iron Works, about six miles distant,


<span class="sidenote">Blaenavon

which employ upwards of four thousand men. The mountainous
territory containing these mineral treasures of iron, was demised by
the crown to the Earl of Abergavenny, and is held under a lease
by Hill and Co. A principal excursion from Abergavenny is that
which leads northwards to Llanthony Abbey, a majestic ruin, seated in


<span class="sidenote">Llanthony

thoroughfare from the west of Wales to Bath, Bristol, and Gloucestershire.
Its principal manufacture is flannel, and its annual fairs for
cattle are well attended.</p>

<p>[A] ABERYSTWITH, a market town and seaport in the hundred of
Glenaur Glynn, and also a township in the parish of Llanbadarn Vawr.
It is situated at the confluence of the rivers Ystwith and Rhyddol, at
which the former falls into the sea in the bay of Cardigan. The building
of a castle, of which some vestiges remain, is attributed to Edward I.
It stands on a craggy eminence projecting into the sea at the west of
the town, and affords a magnificent view of the whole line of Welsh
coast within the bay of Cardigan. The streets are steep and uneven.&mdash;The
houses, which are principally formed of dark slate, present a very
singular appearance. For some years past its celebrity, as a summer
retreat and bathing-place, has been annually increasing, which is greatly


<span class="sidenote">Fine bathing
place.</span>


contributed to by the beauty of the neighbourhood, and the commanding
prospects around. The roads to it have been made excellent, and
the customary amusements of plays and assemblies during the season add
to the attractions for summer visitants. There was formerly a herring
fishery, and the practice of fishing is still carried on with considerable
advantage by the natives. About seven miles north of Aberystwith, on
the sea coast, a considerable extent of land, has, by drainage, been


<span class="sidenote">Twelve
miles of embankment.</span>


recovered; twelve miles of embankment have been formed; and two
navigable cuts, with a road of three miles and a stone bridge completed.</p>

<p>[B] ABINGDON, at the very edge of the county of Berkshire, was
called Shovesham, by the Anglo-Saxons, until the foundation of the


<span class="sidenote">Monastery
of Benedictine
monks.</span>


abbey, from which period it began to assume the name of Abbandeen,
or the Town of the Abbey. This monastery, the monks of which were
Benedictines, was founded by Cissa, an Anglo-Saxon monarch, in 675.
During the reign of Alfred it was demolished by the Danes, and
remained in ruins till King Edgar partly restored it, in 954. Ethelwold,
the abbot at that time, erected and embellished the church, and his
successors contributed to its increase. After the Conquest, the wealth
and grandeur of the abbey were equal to any similar foundation in
England. William the Conqueror kept Easter in the abbey, A.D. 1084;


<span class="sidenote">William the

Jeffery of
Monmouth

and here was educated his youngest son, Henry, surnamed Beauclerc,
afterwards King Henry I., in whose reign, one of the most eminent
characters who received sepulture within the abbey, was the celebrated
Jeffery of Monmouth, author of the British History,&mdash;a work, from
which some of our best poets have derived materials for their sublime
compositions. Shakspeare's Lear, and Milton's Comus, were both
supplied from Jeffery's history. He flourished in the reign of Henry I.
Among the natives of Abingdon, whose talents have rendered their
possessors eminent, was Sir John Mason, a statesman of the sixteenth
century. His memory is the more worthy to be revered,
because, from a very obscure origin, his genius and perseverance


<span class="sidenote">Sir J. Mason,
born
here&mdash;his father
a cow-herd.</span>


advanced him to the rank of privy-counsellor, ambassador to France, and
chancellor of the University of Oxford. His father was a cow-herd
and his mother, sister to one of the abbey monks, who attended to his
early tuition, and sent him to Oxford, where he became a fellow of
All Souls' college. While in this situation, the liveliness of his temper
occasioned him to be chosen to compliment Henry VIII. on his visit to
the University, in the year 1523, which being executed in a most
graceful manner, engaged the favour of the monarch, who promoted him
to the honourable offices above-mentioned. He died in 1566, and was
buried in St. Paul's cathedral.</p>

<p>[B] ACONBURY. At this place a nunnery of the order of St. Augustine
was founded by Margery, wife of Walter de Lacey, in the reign

<span class="sidenote">Nunnery.</span>

of King John. The Cliffords were large benefactors to this house,
which, at the dissolution, possessed <i>&pound;75. 7s. 6d.</i> per annum. There
are some remains yet standing, occupied as a farm house. On the summit
of Aconbury Hill, a bold and extensive eminence, well wooded, and
commanding a charming view over the adjacent county, are traces of a
large encampment.</p>


<p>[C] ACTON BURNELL is celebrated for the remains of an ancient
castle, founded by Robert Burnell, bishop of Bath and Wells, a man of
eminent abilities, first treasurer, and afterwards chancellor of England,
who was much employed by King Edward I. in Welsh affairs. He died
at Berwick, in 1292, and was buried in the cathedral at Wells. The
castle is a quadrangular building, with a square tower at each corner.
The hall in which King Edward I. held his parliament, in 1283, was


<span class="sidenote">Edward I.

parliament
here in
1283.</span>


183 feet long, by 41 broad, but the gable ends only remain. The
Statutum de Mercatoribus enacted here, is from that circumstance better
known as the Statute of Acton Burnell. The successor of the bishop, at
the castle, was Sir Edward Burnell, son of Philip Burnell and Maud,
daughter of Richard Arundel. He served in many actions in Scotland,
under Edward I., and always appeared in great splendour, attended by a
chariot decked with banners of his arms. He was summoned to parliament
from the fifth to the eighth year of Edward the second's reign, and died
in 1315. In 1346, the castle came into the possession of Nicholas Lord
Burnell, who died in 1382, and is buried in the church under an altar
tomb, inlaid with his effigy in brass. In the reign of Henry VI. the Lovell

family were in possession of this estate, which was forfeited by Lord
Lovell, in consequence of his adherence to King Richard III. Henry
VII. being seated on the throne, granted Acton Burnell, together with
other estates in this county, to Jasper Tudor, Earl of Bedford; after
whose death it reverted to the crown, and Henry VIII. granted it to
Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, distinguished for his valour at the battle
of Flodden. Sir Humphrey Lee, of Langley, in this parish, was created
a baronet, May 3, 1620. Acton Burnell Park is now the residence of Sir
Edward Joseph Smythe, Bart. whose family have been seated here from
the time of Charles II., when Sir Edward Smythe, of Esh, in Durham,


<span class="sidenote">The seat of
Sir E.J.
Smythe.</span>


created a baronet, Feb. 23, 1660, married the daughter and heiress of Sir
Richard Lee, Bart. of Langley. The mansion, on a verdant lawn,
bordered by a shrubbery, presents a handsome elevation of fine white
stone, having a noble Ionic portico, under which is the carriage entrance.
Behind the house is the deer park, on a finely wooded eminence, affording
one of the most beautiful prospects in the county. The chapelry of
Ruckley and Langley is in this parish.</p>

the residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The manor of Addington
is held by the feudal service of finding a man to make a mess, called
Gerout, in the king's kitchen, at the coronation, and serving it up in


<span class="sidenote">Coronation
custom.</span>


his own person at Westminster Hall. In the reign of William the
Conqueror, Addington appears to have been held by Tezelin, cook to
the king, which accounts for the origin of the required culinary service.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is now the claimant of the service
alluded to. Near the village is a curious cluster of tumuli, or mounds


<span class="sidenote">Cluster of

of earth raised over the bodies of the slain, about twenty-five in
number, of inconsiderable height. One of them is nearly forty feet
in diameter, two are about half that size, and the rest very small.</p>


<p>[B] ADDLE. The church in this town is considered to be one of the
most perfect specimens of Roman architecture remaining in England.
In 1702, the traces of an ancient Roman town, with fragments of urns,


<span class="sidenote">Roman

and of an aqueduct of stone were found in the adjacent moor.</p>


<p>[C] ADDLINGFLEET. A parish and township in the lower division
of Osgold Cross, including the townships of Fockerby, Haldenby, and
Eastoft. The village is situated very near the junction of the
Trent with the Humber, the latter river being one of the largest
in the kingdom, formed by the united waters of the Trent, Ouse,
Derwent, Aire, and other minor streams. At this part it is about a mile
broad, it is the Abus of Ptolemy. It runs towards the east, washing the
port of Hull, where it receives the river called by the same name;
from thence, taking a south-easterly direction, it expands itself into
<span class="sidenote">Boundary
between
Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire.</span>
an estuary nearly seven miles across, and mingles with the German
ocean. This river, which, with very few exceptions, receives all the
waters of Yorkshire from the Ouse, and the greater part of those from
the midland counties from the Trent, commands the inland navigation of
very extensive and commercial parts of England; namely, those of the
Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Severn, Thames, and Avon; it also forms the
boundary between Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>[C] St. AGNES is situated on the Bristol Channel. The town and parish,
including a considerable mining district, is thickly strewed with the
cottages of the miners. It is more frequently called Lighthouse


<span class="sidenote">Very high
and strong
light-house.</span>


Island, from a very high and strong light-house erected here, to warn
the mariner from the rocks, which are more numerous about this than
any other of the Scilly Islands. This building is upwards of sixty
feet high, and stands on the most elevated ground. The light is produced
by twenty-one parabolic reflectors of copper, plated with silver,
and having each an argand lamp in its focus. The reflectors are
disposed of in three clusters, of seven in each cluster, and the frame in
which they are fixed stands perpendicularly to the horizon, on a shaft
united to a machine below, which makes the whole revolve every two
minutes. By this motion the light progressively sweeps the whole
horizon; and by its gradual intermission and increase, it is readily
distinguished from any other. Its brilliancy is also extraordinary; and
by these combined efforts its benefits are greatly increased, as the
seaman is at once rendered completely sensible of his situation. This
light was designed by the ingenious Mr. Adam Walker, (lecturer on
natural and experimental philosophy,) under whose inspection it was
constructed. The light-house itself is of stone, and was erected, as
appears from an inscription over the door, by Captain Hugh Till, and
Captain Simon Bayley, in the year 1680. The charges attending the
light are defrayed by the Trinity House. At St. Agnes is a pilchard

fishery. St. Agnes' Beacon, six hundred and sixty-four feet above
the level of the sea, is formed out of an ancient cairn, or tumulus
of stones; near which, a summer-house has been built, from whence
is a fine view of St. Ives, and an extensive sea prospect. Near the same
spot is St. Agnes' Well, of which many miraculous stories are in circulation,
from its presumed holy and sanative properties.</p>

<p>This place gave birth to John Opie, whose persevering genius


<span class="sidenote">Birthplace
of John
Opie, the
painter.</span>


advanced him to the highest rank in his profession. He was born at
Harmony Cot, in May 1761. The opening years of his existence
indicated that he must plod through life in the dull occupation of a
carpenter, as successor to his father and grandfather. He distinguished
himself at a very early period, for originality and strength of mind,
and at twelve years of age commenced an evening school in St. Agnes,
teaching arithmetic and writing, and reckoning amongst his scholars
some who had nearly doubled his years. His first humble attempts at


<span class="sidenote">First attempts
at
portrait
painting.</span>


portrait painting were with a smutty stick, against the white-washed
wall of his paternal cottage, where he exhibited, in <i>dark colours</i>, very
striking likenesses of the whole family. His next step was to draw
with ochre on cartridge paper. He was apprenticed to his father,
but from some unascertainable cause was turned over to a sawyer;
and it was literally in the bottom of a saw-pit that Dr. Walcot, better
known by the appellation of Peter Pindar, (who had previously seen
and admired some of Opie's rude drawings,) first beheld this untutored


<span class="sidenote">Genius fostered
by Dr.
Walcot.</span>


child of genius, under whose patronage he was protected, and his fame
promoted. After visiting Exeter, (where he was persuaded to change
his surname, which originally was Hoppy, to that of Opie,) finding his
success was commensurate with his abilities, it was soon determined
they should be brought to act in a wider sphere; and, in 1780, the Doctor
and his pupil repaired to London, where not agreeing as to the
mode of living together, they separated, and although their attachment
had been cemented by long-continued kindness, subsequently to


<span class="sidenote">Anecdotes
of Opie.</span>


this period, yet they were never after cordially united. The opinion Opie
entertained of the services which he had received from the Doctor, may
be gathered from the following curious <i>note of hand</i>, which was said to be
in the possession of the latter: "I promise to paint, for Dr. Walcot, any
picture or pictures, he may demand, as long as I live; otherwise, I
desire the world will consider me as a ... ungrateful son of a ...,
John Opie." It is not certain that he ever deviated from this voluntary
obligation, but it is matter of pleasant remark, that he always made
his friend pay eighteen-pence for the canvass! Opie was as fortunate in


<span class="sidenote">Introduction
to the
King.</span>


London as he had been at Exeter. To Pindar, however, he was
indebted for his introduction to public notice. Through him his
pictures were shown to Mrs. Boscawen, by whom Opie was introduced
to the late Mrs. Delaney, who procured for him the notice of King
George III. An opportunity was contrived for the royal family to see
his picture of the <i>The Old Beggar Man</i>; soon after which, Opie was
honoured with a command to repair to Buckingham House. The
artist's account of this interview was given in the following characteristical
manner to Walcot, who has often been heard to relate it
with great humour. "There was Mr. West," said Opie, "in the room,


<span class="sidenote">Opie's relation
of his
interview
with
royalty.</span>


and another gentleman. First, her majesty came in; and I made a sad
mistake in respect to her, till I saw her face, and discovered by her
features that she was the queen. In a few minutes his majesty came
hopping in. I suppose," said Opie, "because he did not wish to
frighten me. He looked at the pictures and liked them; but he
whispered to Mr. West&mdash;'tell the young man I can only pay a gentleman's

<span class="sidenote">Royal economy.</span>

price for them.'" The picture which his majesty bought was
that of <i>A Man Struck by Lightning</i>. The price given was &pound;10,
with which Opie returned to the Doctor full of spirits. His friend,
when he heard the story, said, "Why, John, thou hast only got
&pound;8. for thy picture." "Indeed, but I have though," cried Opie, "for
I have got the &pound;10. safe in my pocket." On this he showed him the
money. "Aye," rejoined the Doctor, "but dost thou know his majesty
has got the frame for nothing, and that is worth &pound;2." "D&mdash;- it, so he
has," cried Opie&mdash;"I'll go back and knock at the door, and ask for the
frame; D&mdash;- it, I will." He was actually about to put his resolve into
execution, till dissuaded by the Doctor. Popularity naturally followed
this notice of royalty. The ladies, however, soon deserted him, as his
likenesses were not flattering; for where Nature had been niggardly,
Opie refused to be liberal. He afterwards became better acquainted
with the art of pleasing them; a change which has been attributed
to Mrs. Opie, who used to stand over him, and endeavour to make him
sensible of the graces of the female form. It was in the year 1786,


<span class="sidenote">First
known as
an exhibitor at Somerset
House,
1786.</span>


that Mr. Opie became known as an exhibitor at Somerset House; soon
after which he aspired to academical honours, and ultimately attained
the rank of Royal Academician, and afterwards succeeded Fuseli, in the
professorship of painting. He was twice married, but at what period
his first hymeneal union occurred we are not informed&mdash;it was inauspicious.
His second marriage, which took place on May 8, 1798, was
more fortunate; and in the society of the late Mrs. Opie, the
amiable author of many beautiful and interesting literary compositions,
he enjoyed a delightful relief from the toilsome duties of his profession.
Mr. Opie was in the daily acquisition of wealth and fame, and rapidly
advancing to the very zenith of popularity, when his mortal career
was suddenly closed by death, on Thursday, April 9, 1807, in the

<span class="sidenote">Died in 1807.</span>

forty-sixth year of his age. "As a portrait painter he has great
claims to praise, particularly in his men, which are firm, bold, and
freely delineated, and occasionally well coloured. His women are
heavy, inelegant, and chiefly accompanied with a hardness that destroys
all beauty."</p>

<p>[A] St. ALBANS is situated on the river Ver, or Muss, and consists of
three parishes; parts of two of which, extend beyond the limits of the


<span class="sidenote">Originally
the British
metropolis.</span>


borough. It is said to have been the site of the ancient British metropolis
of Cassibelanus, and is very near that of the ancient Roman
Verulam, mentioned by Tacitus, being the same as the Saxon Watlingceaster,
so called because seated on the road called Watling-street.
It was here that Queen Boadicea made her celebrated assault on the
Romans, and failed, after an immense slaughter of seventy thousand men.
In 795, Offa, king of Mercia, erected an abbey here, in memory of St.
Alban, the British protomartyr, who was born here in the third century.
He served in the Roman army, but was converted to Christianity
by a monk, named Amphilabus, and suffered during the Dioclesian persecution,
A.D. 303. The abbey subsequently obtained great privileges,
and became very rich, the revenues at the dissolution amounting
to upwards of &pound;2500. per annum. Monastic foundations had their origin
in this country, about the time of St. Augustine, who came from Rome,
to convert the Pagan Saxons to Christianity; and when Offa ascended
the throne of Mercia, about twenty great monasteries had been founded
in England, and about the same number of episcopal sees established.
Offa's zeal prompted him to do what many of his crowned predecessors


<span class="sidenote">King Offa's
extraordinary
vision,
which induced
him
to build the
abbey.</span>


had done; but being undetermined whom to select as the patron saint
of his establishment, it is recorded that, while at the city of Bath, an
angel appeared to him in the silence of the night, desiring him to
raise out of the earth the body of Alban, the first British martyr,
and place his remains in a suitable shrine. Even the memory
of Alban had been lost for three hundred and forty years; but
the king assembling his clergy and people at Verulam, an active search
was made for his body with prayer, fasting, and alms; when it is said a ray
of light was seen by all to stand over the place of burial, similar to the
star that conducted the magi to Bethlehem. The ground was therefore
opened, and, in the presence of the king, the body of Alban was found.
Offa is said to have placed a golden circle round the head of the


<span class="sidenote">St. Alban's
body found
after a lapse
of 494 years;
a golden circle
placed
round his
head.</span>


deceased, with an inscription, to signify his name and title, and immediately
caused the remains of the saint to be conveyed to a small chapel,
without the walls of Verulam, as the town was then called, until a more
noble edifice could be raised for its reception. This is said to have
occurred on the 1st day of August, 791, four hundred and ninety-four
years after the martyrdom of Alban. Offa afterwards made a journey to
Rome, and obtained the desired privileges of his intended foundation,
with great commendations for his zeal and piety, from the pope, when
he undertook to build a stately church and monastery, to the memory of
St. Alban. From this abbey the town originated, which early obtained
considerable importance. The abbey church, which claims particular
attention for its size, beauty, and antiquity, is constructed of Roman
brick, to which age has given the appearance of stone. A stone screen,
erected before the communion table, in 1461, is much admired for the
richness and lightness of its sculpture. The tombs of the founder,
Offa, and that of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, are shown here; and, not


<span class="sidenote">Duke of
Gloucester's
body

entire.</span>


many years ago, the leaden coffin, containing the body of the latter,
was opened, and the corpse found nearly entire. The Roman antiquities
discovered on the site have been very numerous. The effect of
the venerable abbey, when seen from a distance, is extremely imposing;
situated upon an eminence, its massive towers rise majestically
above the houses of the ancient town, which is well, known to have
derived its first importance from the Romans, since which, it has
increased chiefly under the protecting influence of successive abbots
of this rich and powerful monastery. The prospect of its mouldering
ruins, forces upon the mind a melancholy train of reflection on the
instability of all human institutions.</p>

George
Crabbe, the

sketch of

the <i>Poet of the Poor</i>, who was born December 24, 1754. His
father was an officer in the Customs, and at first gave him an education,
merely suitable to follow the same pursuit; but when his prospects
brightened, he removed his son to a classical seminary, where he
was instructed for a surgeon and apothecary, to which profession
he was in due time apprenticed, but relinquished all views of establishing
himself in practice. At a very early period he became a
versifier; and among his precocious attempts was a prize poem, on
<i>Hope</i>, which was inserted in the <i>Lady's Magazine</i>, then published by
Mr. Wheeble. Crabbe came to London, in 1778, with &pound;3. in his


<span class="sidenote">Crabbe's
arrival in

pocket, and made versification his chief study. His first published
work was <i>The Candidate</i>, a poem, in quarto, which came into the
world anonymously, in 1780, and was favourably received. A short
time afterwards, his poverty and poetry induced him to seek the


<span class="sidenote">His first
published
work well
received.</span>


patronage of Edmund Burke, to whom he submitted a large quantity of
miscellaneous composition; he had no introduction to Mr. Burke,
excepting his own letter, stating his circumstances; no recommendation
but his distress, and yet his application was attended with success. His
patron introduced him to some of the first men in the country, and soon
after became the means of benefiting his fame and fortune; he selected
from young Crabbe's works, <i>The Library</i> and <i>The Village</i>, suggesting
at the same time certain corrections and improvements. Among the
eminent persons to whom he was thus introduced, was the Right Hon.
Charles James Fox, Sir Joshua Reynolds, at whose mansion he first


<span class="sidenote">Crabbe's

beheld, and was made known to, Dr. Johnson, who gave the young
poet his opinion of <i>The Village</i>. Mr. Burke having directed Mr.
Crabbe's views to the church, in 1781 he was ordained a deacon by the
Bishop of Norwich, and priest by the same dignitary in the following
year; he was next appointed domestic chaplain to the Duke of Rutland
at Belvoir Castle. As Mr. Crabbe had not received a university education,
he was offered a degree by Trinity College, Cambridge, but
eventually received the grant from the Archbishop of Canterbury,
at Lambeth, and thus became a Bachelor of Laws. Burke also


<span class="sidenote">Promoted to
the church.</span>


introduced Mr. Crabbe to Lord Chancellor Thurlow, who presented
him to rectories in Dorset and Lincoln consecutively. He had previously
a curacy at Strathorn, a village near Belvoir Castle, where he married
and became a father; he was universally respected for his talents and
virtues, and died at Trowbridge, at seven o'clock in the morning of

<p>[B] ALDINGTON. Elizabeth Barton, commonly called the Holy
Maid of Kent, a religious impostor, lived in the reign of Henry
VIII. She was a servant at Aldington, and having been for a long


<span class="sidenote">The History
of the Holy
Maid of
Kent.</span>


time afflicted with convulsions, which distorted her limbs and countenance,
and threw her body into the most violent agitations, acquired a
power of counterfeiting the same appearances whenever she pleased.
Richard Master, who then held this living, with other ecclesiastics,
thinking her a proper instrument for their purpose, induced her to
pretend that all she said and did, was by a supernatural impulse, and
taught her to act her part in the most perfect manner. Thus she pretended
to be honoured with visions; to hear heavenly voices and most
ravishing melody; she declaimed against the wickedness of the times,
against heresy and innovations; exhorting all persons to frequent the
church, to hear masses, to make frequent confessions, and to pray
to our lady, and all saints. This artful management, with her apparent
piety, virtue, and austerity of life, completely deceived even Sir
Thomas More, Bishop Fisher, and Archbishop Warham, the last of which
appointed commissioners to examine her, to whom she was instructed
to say, in her counterfeit trances, that she should never recover till she
went to visit the image of the Virgin Mary, in a chapel dedicated to her
in this parish, which was done. After that she pretended that she was
called to be a nun, and the Archbishop being fully satisfied with the
reports, had her placed in the nunnery of St. Sepulchre, Canterbury,


<span class="sidenote">Holy Maid
of Kent.</span>


where she alleged she had visions and revelations of a divine nature,
so as to completely impose upon the public. The main object of the priests,
her managers, was directed publicly to announce how God had revealed
to her, "that in case the king should divorce Queen Catherine of Anjou,
and take another wife during her life, his royalty would not be of a
month's duration, but that he should die the death of a villain," which
created considerable excitement, and much controversy: encouraged
by the lenity of the government, the ecclesiastics in this conspiracy,
resolved to publish the revelations of the nun throughout the kingdom.
They had communicated them to the Pope's Ambassadors, and
exhorted Queen Catherine to persist in her resolutions. At length this


<span class="sidenote">The imposture
detected.</span>


confederacy became a serious affair, and Henry ordered the maid and
her accomplices to be examined in the Star Chamber, where they confessed
all the particulars of the imposture; and afterwards, upon a
scaffold erected at Paul's Cross, were compelled to hear their confession
publicly read; they were confined in the Tower until the meeting of parliament,
by whom the whole affair was pronounced to be a conspiracy
against the king's life, and crown. The nun, and her confederates, were


<span class="sidenote">Herself and
confederates
executed
at
Tyburn.</span>


eventually attainted of high treason, and executed at Tyburn, April
20th, 1534, where she confessed the imposture, laying the blame
on her accomplices, the priests; craving pardon of God, and the King.</p>

<p>[A] ALDSTONE MOOR, in Leath Ward, is situated on the borders of
Northumberland, in the most picturesque and romantic part of the


<span class="sidenote">Picturesque

county. The town itself stands upon a hill, at the bottom of which
runs the river Tyne. The immediate vicinity abounds in lead-mines,
on estates which once belonged to the Derwentwater family. On the
attainder of the last earl, they were granted in aid of the support of
Greenwich Hospital, from the trustees of which national institution, the
mines are at present leased. Satin spar is found in this parish; there
is also a pool on Gildersdale Fell, the slime of which is used for painting

discovered.</p>

<p>[B] ALDWORTH is pleasantly situated on a hill: here was anciently
a mansion belonging to the family of De La Beche, the site of which is
now Beach Farm. In the churchyard is a remarkable yew-tree, the

from the ground. The church is celebrated for its very ancient monuments,
nine in number, disposed in enriched arches on each side, and

in the centre of the interior; these are supposed to belong to the
De La Beche family, and from the costume of the figures upon the
tombs, may be referred to the fourteenth century; six of them are
knights in armour; two are females, and one in the common habit
of the time; some of the knights are represented lying cross-legged;
these had vowed, or accompanied a crusade; the workmanship is
excellent, and the attitude and expression of each of the figures that
remain perfect, are exceedingly graceful, but several of the monuments
are now considerably mutilated. The font is very ancient, and
remarkably plain, but very capacious, and somewhat singular in its
form.</p>

hundred years, when Sir Richard, the last heir, who died unmarried,
left the estate by will to his mother, who, afterwards by marriage,
conveyed it to the Arundel family, and from them it became the property
of the Honourable, William Monkton Arundel, Viscount Galway,
whose son, the late Lord Galway, sold it in the year 1786, to the late
Duke of York, who afterwards occasionally resided in the park, with
George IV., then Prince of Wales. The estate, comprising four thousand

<p>[A] ALLINGTON. Situated in the hundred of Larkefield, in the
lathe of Aylesford, near the river Medway. <span class="smcap">Allington Castle</span> was
originally built in the Saxon times, by a noble family denominated

<span class="sidenote">The castle.</span>

<i>Columbary</i>, but was razed afterwards by the Danes. The manor was
given after the conquest to Bishop Odo, (in whose time there was


<span class="sidenote">Mansion
given to
Bishop Odo.</span>


a <i>church</i> at Allington,) and on his disgrace, to the great Earl Warrenne,
who is stated to have had the castle rebuilt, which, however, seems
to be doubtful, as the famous Sir Stephen Penchester, constable of
Dover Castle, in the reign of Edward I., and then owner of this manor,
had a license to fortify, and embattle, his mansion-house here. It
passed afterwards to the <i>Cobham</i> family; and from them to the <i>Brents</i>,
by whom it was alienated to Sir Henry Wyatt, a descendant from


<span class="sidenote">Sir Henry
Wyatt deprived
of seventeen
manors and

for treason.</span>


a worthy Yorkshire family; who, besides losing seventeen manors, was
deprived of his liberty for engaging in the plot against Richard III. in
favour of the Earl of Richmond; but when success had crowned the
attempts of the latter, he was released by the new king, knighted,
made banneret, a knight of the bath, and a privy counsellor. He
made this castle his residence; and here was born his accomplished
son and successor, Sir Thomas Wyatt. This gentleman who was equally
renowned, as a scholar, a soldier, and a statesman, (in consequence
of which he was considered to be "the delight of the muses and
mankind") made this a "fair seat," and was visited here by Henry VIII.,


<span class="sidenote">Sir Thomas
Wyatt, was an accomplished
scholar,
soldier and
statesman.</span>


(as his father Sir Henry had also been,) with whom he was a great
favourite; though he appears in some degree to have unintentionally
excited his jealousy, through the admiration which his accomplishments
had raised in the breast of the fascinating Anne Boleyn. He died
in his thirty-eighth year, at Sherborne, in Dorsetshire, of a violent
fever. His son Sir Thomas Wyatt, the younger, being deprived of
his estates and life, for treason against Queen Mary, this castle and
manor became vested in the crown, and were granted, on lease by
Elizabeth, to John Astley Esq., master of her jewels, in her eleventh
year. His son, Sir John Astley, afterwards had the whole granted to him
by the queen's letters patent, dated in her twenty-sixth year, and from

of one
house, a

his family it was transferred to that of Lord Romney, and is now the
property of the present earl. The remains of the castle are particularly
curious and interesting, but give the idea rather of a fortified dwelling,
than of a place of strength. The moat still exists, as does the
entrance gateway, which was erected by the Cobhams. Besides the
castle and parsonage, (a mere cottage,) there is only one house in this
parish; though Sir Stephen de Penchester is recorded to have procured
a grant of a market weekly, and a three days annual fair for his manor
of Allington.</p>

founded by patent from James I. and endowed with about &pound;120 per

It was anciently called Albanbury. In the neighbourhood traces
of an ancient castle, on an eminence, are still discernable. It is supposed,
by some antiquarians, to have been the Campodonum of the

<p>[B] ALNWICK, is on the high road from London to Berwick, and
usually regarded as the capital of the county. It is situated partly in the
southern division of Barnborough Ward, and partly in the eastern division
of Coquetdale Ward. It is built irregularly, on the declivities of a
hill, near the river Alne, over which a handsome stone bridge was erected
by the late Duke of Northumberland, which bears the Percy crest
on the parapet; there is also another bridge, of one arch, lower down
the river; these two bridges serve as boundaries to the fine lawns
surrounding the castle. At the head of Pottergate is a tower or
clock-house, built in 1786. An abbey of Premonstratension canons


<span class="sidenote">An abbey
of monks,
founded in
1147.</span>


was founded at Alnwick by Eustace St. John, in the year 1147. It
was pleasantly situated on the northern margin of the Alne, the site
of which was granted, in 1549, to Ralph Sadler, and Lawrence Wennington,
after which it became the seat of the Brandling family, and
also of the Doubleday family, by whom it was sold to the Duke
of Northumberland. A fine gate house still remains, on which the
Percy arms is visible. This town has a spacious market place,
and a considerable town hall, in which the sessions and county
courts are held. It is paved, watched, and lighted, under an act passed
in 1821. Although the county town, the assizes are held at Newcastle.
Alnwick Castle has been for many centuries a fortress of great


<span class="sidenote">Fortress of
great
strength.</span>


strength, and the family mansion of the Percys'; it stands on an eminence
on the south side of the Alne, opposite to the town, and commands a
beautiful view of the country. The walls are flanked with sixteen
gothic towers, the battlements of which, are ornamented with figures of
ancient warriors: it is very celebrated in border history, and was peculiarly
fatal to the kings of Scotland, of whom Malcolm II. and his son Edward,


<span class="sidenote">The fall of
Malcolm II.
and his son
Edward.</span>


fell before it; and William, surnamed the Lion, was taken prisoner.
The castle has lately undergone a complete repair; great attention
having been paid to the restoration of the gothic ornaments in their
original style. The chapel has been rendered extremely beautiful, by
the introduction of a ceiling, in imitation of the celebrated one of
King's College, Cambridge. There is also a handsome window, on the
model of one at York Minster, and the walls are painted in the manner
of those of the cathedral of Milan. The tenants of the estate at
Alnwick, in the year 1818, erected a monument to the memory of


<span class="sidenote">Monument

the late Duke of Northumberland, who died in 1817, and was
buried in Westminster Abbey. The Percy column, as it is called,
stands on a beautiful knoll, adjoining the road on the southern
entrance to the town; it rises without a pedestal, and may be seen
in every direction, it is eighty-three feet in height, but may be
ascended easily by a circular flight of stairs within. There is an
immemorial custom continued here on the proclamation of the several


<span class="sidenote">Curious
customs in
Alnwick.</span>


fairs; divers adjacent townships, which are free of toll in the borough,
by this service, send their deputies to attend the bailiff, on the
eve of the fair, when he makes proclamation; after which they keep
watch all night in every part of the town, and this is the most
perfect remains of watch and ward retained in any part of this
country. It is said that King John, having endured considerable inconvenience
from the miry state of the roads, in humorous revenge, directed
that for the future, the freemen of Alnwick, should be made in the following
manner, which is still observed.&mdash;On St. Mark's day, those who


<span class="sidenote">Making

are to be made free, assemble in the market place, dressed in white,
with white caps, and a sword by their side. They proceed on horseback
from this place to the town moor, headed by the four chamberlains,
attired in the same manner, where they alight and rush through a
muddy pool; having performed this ceremony, they change their soiled
garments, and return to the town. Here is a free school, supported
by a revenue arising out of the tolls, and various minor charities.</p>

of Halfshire; it was formerly a borough and governed by a bailiff, chosen
annually at the court of the lord of the manor. The church is a large

structure of Anglo Norman architecture, but the tower is modern. It
however contains many ancient monuments: a hospital was founded
here by Nicholas Lewkenor, of Hadsor, in 1580. The bishops of the
county formerly had a palace here. Bishop Brain, Chancellor of
England, in the reign of Edward III., to whom the Black Prince, wrote a
circumstantial account of the battle of Poicters, died here in 1361. Bishop
Latimer put it in repair in the reign of Henry VIII., it seems to have
been merely a timber building. It has not been inhabited by any Bishop
since the restoration, and was nearly a century ago, entirely pulled
down, when the park was converted into farms. The river Arrow,
which rises in the Lickey Hills, runs through the parish, towards


<span class="sidenote">Dilapidations

Beoley Park, and Warwickshire; and the Ikenield Street, also passes
it. This town formerly consisted of several streets, but is now fallen
into decay, it however, receives some benefit from the Worcester canal,
which passes it, and joins the Stratford-and-Avon canal, at King's
Norton.</p>


<p>[B] ALVESTON. This parish contains the vestiges of two Roman

<p>[C] AMBLESIDE is seated on the decline of a hill, at the extremity
of the romantic lake Winandermere, of which a branch passes through
the town. It is held by Horsley, to be the site of the Roman Dictus.

<p>[A] AMERSHAM, or Agmondesham is situated on the Misbourne, a
branch of the river Colne. The town which is seated in a vale between
two wooded hills, consists of a long street on the road from Uxbridge
to Wendover; it is intersected about the centre, by a cross street from
Chesham to High Wycombe, at the point of which stands the church.
The market is held in the Market House, or Town Hall, built by Sir
William Drake, about 1680; it is a brick building supported by pillars


<span class="sidenote">Town Hall,
built by Sir
W. Drake,
1680.</span>


and arches, with a lanthorn and clock, and said to be the handsomest in
the county. Amersham was a parliamentary borough by prescription, but
by the Reform Bill of 1832, is now disfranchised. The church was extensively
repaired in 1778, in the chancel of which are monuments of the
family of the Bents of Leicestershire, who had a seat in the parish; and a
monument of Henry, son of Sir Patrick Curwen, Bart., who died in 1638;
and also several monuments of the Drake family, in the chancel and the
adjoining mausoleum; among which are those of Montague Gerrard, by
<i>Sheemaker</i>, and the wife of the late Mr. Drake, by Henry Cheere.
About a mile northward from the town, is Shardeloes Park, the seat
of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt Drake: the estate was formerly in the


<span class="sidenote">Shardeloes
park.</span>


possession of the Brudenell's, which family terminated in a peeress,
and brought Shardeloes to the Cheynes; afterwards it became the seat
of William Totehill, Esq., where he entertained Queen Elizabeth in


<span class="sidenote">Entertainment of Queen Elizabeth.</span>


one of her progresses. Francis Drake, of East Sherwin, Surrey,
who was one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to James I., married
Jane, the daughter and heiress of William Totehill, Esq. The mansion
is beautifully situated on the brow of a hill, overlooking an immense
sheet of water, covering thirty-five acres, and commands a delightful
prospect, particularly towards the east, where the town of Amersham,
and the surrounding eminences, covered with wood, present a very
picturesque appearance. The gardens, formerly much admired for


<span class="sidenote">Picturesque
views.</span>


their beauty, were originally formed by Sir William Drake, about 1666,
but have been modernized by Richmond, for the late proprietor. Here
is also a Free Grammar School, the scholars of which are entitled to
three exhibitions in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, bequeathed by
Dr. Challoner, a canon of Windsor, in 1620; and likewise four alms
houses, with other minor charities. The manufactures are chiefly lace,
sacking, and all kinds of white cotton, wrought by machinery; and the
markets are well attended.</p>

<p>[B] AMESBURY, or Ambresbury, is situated on the river Avon, and
is said to derive its name and origin from an abbey, founded by the
British Prince Ambrosius; which abbey was subsequently changed


<span class="sidenote">Founded by
the British
Prince Ambrosius.</span>


into a convent of Benedictine monks, of which some remains are still
to be seen. In the parish, and about two miles from the town, is the
celebrated British monument, known by the name of Stone-henge.
Antiquaries differ in their opinions as to the probable application of
this structure; the majority, however, deem it to have been a druidical

<span class="sidenote">Stone-henge.</span>

temple, or a grand tribunal of justice. Out of twenty-four enormous
stones, of which the outer circular range appears to have been formed,
seventeen are still standing, and seven on the ground; of the inner
circle, eleven out of the nineteen of which it was formed are still upright,
and the remainder prostrate. The distance of the inner circle from the
outer one is about eight feet, forming a walk between the two of about
three hundred feet in circumference; the stones are from eighteen to
twenty feet high, from six to seven feet broad, and about three feet thick,
and there is an appearance of the whole having been surrounded with a
trench, over which were three passages. There are numerous barrows and
tumuli around it, where many skeletons and military weapons have been
discovered. Conjecture has been at a loss to ascertain the means by which
such solid masses could have been conveyed, and placed in so elevated a
situation without the aid of machinery. It stands near the summit of a
hill; even at the distance of half a mile the appearance is awful; but on a
nearer approach, the eye is still more delighted with the greatness of its
contour. On entering the building, either on foot or horseback, these


<span class="sidenote">Its awful
appearance.</span>


ruins fill the mind with astonishment, which it is impossible for the pen
adequately to describe. Other buildings have fallen by piece-meal&mdash;here
a single stone is a ruin. As you advance farther, the greatness of every
part, and the singular construction of the whole, causes additional surprise.
Some authors suppose that this noble temple does not owe its defacement
so much to the introduction of Christianity, as to the rude and barbarous
hands of the neighbouring peasantry, who have carried away the stones
for their own purposes. At a house which occupies part of the ancient nunnery,


<span class="sidenote">Nunnery of
St. Augustine.</span>


a society of nuns of St. Augustine, from Flanders, have taken up
their abode, probably attracted by the supposed sanctity of the situation.
Near the town stands the once celebrated house of the Dukes of Queensbury,
built by Inigo Jones, and subsequently improved by the Earl of
Burlington. The neighbourhood abounds with clay used for making
tobacco pipes, and the river Avon supplies a very much admired species of
fish called loach. In the vicinity is a camp, called Vespasians. It consists


<span class="sidenote">Camp of 39
acres.</span>


of a triangular area of 39 acres, defended by a ditch and vallum, and
bounded on two sides by the Avon. This may have been occupied by the
Romans, but its construction and position indicate a British origin.</p>

<p>[A] ALMWICH, a seaport town in the parish of the same name, in the
hundred of Twerclyn. It is situated on the north coast of the Island of
Anglesey; and from a small village (in consequence of the discovery of a
rich copper-mine in the Parys mountain) has been augmented into a considerable
town: the appearance of this celebrated mountain is very rude;
it is bare of vegetation, in consequence of the suffocating fumes which
issue from it. The Romans are supposed to have obtained copper ore


<span class="sidenote">From this
place the
Romans
obtained
copper ore.</span>


from this place, as many vestiges of what, it is imagined, were their operations,
are still traceable. The great riches of the site were not, however,
discovered until March 2, 1768, by the lessees of Sir Nicholas Bayley,
afterwards Earl of Uxbridge; and equally successful was the Rev. Edward
Hughes, proprietor of another part of the same ridge. The substance of
the mountain being ore, it has not been worked in the usual way, by
shafts and levels, but by direct excavation. "Nature," Mr. Pennant observes,
"hath been profuse in bestowing her mineral favours on this spot,
for above the copper ore, and not more than three-quarters of a yard
beneath the common soil, is a bed of yellowish greasy clay, from one to
four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from six hundred to a
thousand pounds weight of lead from one ton; and one ton of the metal


<span class="sidenote">Lead ore
which yields
silver also.</span>


yields not less than fifty-seven ounces of silver. Mixed with the earth are
frequently certain parts, of the colour of cinnabar; whether these are
symptomatic of the sulphurous arsenical silver ores, or of quick-silver, I
will not pretend to decide. Something interferes with the successful smelting
of this earth in the great, insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit
to the adventurers, which might reasonably be expected from the crucible
assays of it." From this mountain arises a mineral water, which turns the
syrup of violets red, without any signs of chalybeate. To enumerate the


<span class="sidenote">Various
minerals.</span>


mineral substances found from time to time would prove a tedious employment,
and perhaps an unimportant one. The following are the principal
and most useful:&mdash;1. Yellow sulphurated copper ore; 2. Native copper,
in small quantities; 3. Sulphate of copper, both chrystallized and in solution;
4. Sulphate of lead, containing a small portion of silver; 5. Black
ore, containing copper with galenea, calamine, and some silver; 6. Native
sulphur. Not far from Parys Mountain is the port whence the ore brought


<span class="sidenote">The port, a
chasm between
the rocks.</span>


from the mines is transported to Liverpool and Swansea; it is a chasm between
two rocks, large enough to receive thirty vessels, each 200 tons.
The two companies employ fifteen brigs, from 100 to 150 tons burden,
besides sloops and other craft. The articles exported from these copper
mines are principally a coarse copper from the smelting-house, a richer
copper ore, dried precipitate of copper from the vitriol pits, refined sulphur,
ochre, alum, and green vitriol. Though much improved by the copper companies,
this port is so exposed to the swell of the ocean, as to make it difficult
and dangerous of access, during the prevalence of high northerly winds.</p>

Under the window at the south-end of the transept, is the tomb of Sir Nicholas
de Villiers and his lady, with their effigies, represented under an
arch. The knight is represented as a crusader, in mail and surtout, with
his legs crossed, his feet resting on a lion, and his right hand on the hilt of
his sword; on his left arm is a shield bearing the Cross of St. George,
charged with five escalop-shells. This figure is of hard blue stone; that of
the lady is of free-stone, and much mutilated. Below the effigies of the
knight is a mutilated inscription in the Saxon character. An ancient mansion,
built by the family of the Hungerfords, in the reign of Henry the
Eighth, was repaired and modernized, as to its exterior, a few years ago.
It belongs, with the manor, to the family of Eliot, of Port Eliot, in Cornwall.</p>

Here is an obelisk of Portland stone, forming a receptacle for a pump; and
also a Gothic cross, which was erected in 1744, to the memory of Catherine

Ampthill Park, at a former period the residence of that ill-treated Queen.

it was constituted a royal domain by Henry VIII., who conferred a

which Queen Catherine resided, stood on a more elevated ground than the
present mansion, which is a magnificent structure, with wings, and a flight
of steps leading to a handsome hall; the park, which is now united with
that of Houghton, is spacious, and presents several most delightful prospects.
At the entrance of Ampthill Park there is a pear tree, under which
it is reported that Sir Philip Sydney wrote a part of his Arcadia.</p>

and grapery are entered from the dining-rooms, which was once a vaulted
roofed ale cellar, or castle prison. A portion of this vault remains unaltered.
From the lawn is a beautiful and interesting view of Tenby. The

church of Amroth, on the road to Ludchurch, is situated on a limestone

<p>[B] GREAT AMWELL is supposed to have derived its name from Emma's


<span class="sidenote">Emma's
Well, one of
sources of

River</span>


Well, a pure water-fountain that issues from a hill, and forms one
of the sources of the New River. Here is a monument erected by Mr.
Milne, to the ill-requited Sir Hugh Middleton, in a small islet formed by
the said river. Sir Hugh, notwithstanding the assistance afforded him by
Parliament, and the City of London, ruined himself by procuring supplies
of water to the metropolis. Great mystery envelopes the latter period of
his life. It is traditionally reported that he retired to the village of Kemberton,


<span class="sidenote">Indigence of
Sir Hugh
Middleton.</span>


near Shiffnall, in Shropshire, where he resided some time in great
indigence, under the assumed name of Raymond, and it is said that during
such residence he was actually employed in paving the streets. The
poet Warner, author of "Albion's England," lies interred here. The
church is situated on an eminence, the picturesque beauty of which has been
justly celebrated by the admirable poet, usually denominated Scott of
Amwell, from his residence in the village, and the title of his poem.</p>


<p>[C] ANCASTER. This parish is situated on the great Roman road, called
Ermin-street, and bears strong evidence of having been a Roman station;
many authors unite to fix here the ancient Causenn&aelig;. It occupies a low
situation, and at the north end flows a small brook. From the vestiges
which remain of military works it has certainly been a place of great
strength. A great number of coins, and other antiquities, have been found
here in such quantities, as to become a source of considerable emolument
to the inhabitants of the place; so much so, that at one time many became
extensive dealers in them. These coins are of various Emperors. Several


<span class="sidenote">Mosaic
pavements.</span>


mosaic pavements have also been discovered here. It is highly probable
from these circumstances, that Ancaster was the Causenn&aelig; of Antoninus.
About the town are several quarries of stone, which is found very near the
surface. Ancaster once gave the title of Duke to the head of the Bertie
family, but that Dukedom is now extinct.</p>



<p>[D] ANDOVER, situated on the river Anton, is supposed to have been
the Andaoreon of the Romans; and this opinion seems to have been countenanced
by the remains of several ancient encampments in the neighbourhood,
and by the Roman road, which runs from Winchester to Cirencester,
and passes through the town. The antiquity of the corporation is as
remote as the reign of John, but the present charter was granted by Queen
Elizabeth; the town is extensive, and two of the streets are handsome and
wide. There is a spacious town-hall, supported by arches, under which
the weekly market is held. The church, situated at the north of the town,
is a large Gothic building, consisting of a nave, side aisles, and chancel,
with a transept on the north, and a low tower rising from the centre; it
existed in the time of the Conqueror, and is dedicated to St. Mary. Within


<span class="sidenote">Weyhill
Fair.</span>


four miles of the town is held the great annual fair of Weyhill, which, as
it lasts for a week, causes much circulation of money in Andover. In addition
to the many small Roman encampments in the immediate neighbourhood,
there is a very large one on the summit of Bury Hill, about two
miles to the S.S.W.</p>

<p>[A] ANGLESEY (Isle and County of), forms one of the six counties of
North Wales, and is situated at the north western extremity of the principality.
It is watered on three sides by the Irish sea, and separated on
the eastern side from Caernarvonshire, by the serpentine strait of Menai,
from three-quarters to half a mile broad. Its form is irregular, being indented
with many small bays and creeks, which gave it some maritime
importance under its native princes. It has received numerous appellations
from the ancient Britons; the most approved of which was Mon, signifying
remote, Latinised by the Romans into Mona, the "nurse of
Wales," from its fruitfulness; and changed by the Saxons into Angles-ey,
or the Englishman's Island. It was the principal establishment of the


<span class="sidenote">Originally
the principal
establishment
of the
Druids.</span>


Druids in Britain, until this island was invaded by the Romans, A.D. 59,
under Suetonius Paulinus, who ordered their groves to be cut down, and
stationed a garrison to insure obedience. The climate of Anglesey is mild,
and the sea-breezes render the weather more temperate here than in the
other counties of North Wales, although from the same cause it is less
clear: that portion of the island which borders on the Menai, the site of
the terrific Druidical groves, is richly wooded. The interior, on the contrary,
owing to the great scarcity of fuel, has been rendered nearly devoid
of wood; and the greater part of the island possesses little of hill and dale
beyond a gentle and undiversified undulation of surface; its general aspect
is uninviting and cheerless. The land, however, is good, and under proper
management very productive, as respects both tillage and pasturage.
About 25,000 head of black cattle (exclusive of sheep and hogs), are


<span class="sidenote">Annual
exportation
of
cattle.</span>


annually supplied to the English market, where they are much admired
for their flavour and tenderness, occasioned by the short bite of the pasturage
on which they feed. Before the erection of the suspension bridge, the
passage of the numerous droves of cattle at the five authorized ferries of the
Menai, was a very extraordinary sight; they were made to swim over,
guided by the drovers in boats. Butter, cheese, hides, tallow, wax, and
honey, form also great articles of trade here; throughout the island there
are but few manufactures of any importance. The shore abounds in some
of the most highly prized marine productions, and is especially celebrated


<span class="sidenote">Prized for its marine productions.
</span>


for the variety and beauty of its sea shells. Anglesey is as interesting to
the antiquary, as to the natural philosopher. The ancient British vestiges
are very numerous; comprising no less than twenty-eight cromlechs,
or Druidical altars, together with circles, monumental stones, entrenchments,
and other remains of a similar description, both British and Roman,
which will receive attention in their proper places; several of the parish
churches (of which the whole, seventy-four, stand near the coast), with various
monastic remains, also deserve examination on the score of antiquity.
Mona, now Anglesey, was the chief seat of the Druids, A.D. 59. Suetonius
Paulinus, in the reign of Nero, was invested with the command of


<span class="sidenote">Invasion of
the Romans</span>


an army, and prepared to signalize his name by victories over those barbarians.
Finding this island the chief seat of the Druids, he resolved to
attack it, and bring into subjection a place which was the centre of their
superstition, and which afforded protection to all their baffled forces. The
Britons endeavoured to obstruct his landing on this sacred island, both by
the force of their arms, and the terrors of their religion. The women and
priests were intermingled with the soldiers upon the shore; and running
about with flaming torches in their hands, and tossing their disheveled
hair, they struck greater terror into the astonished Romans by their howlings,
cries and execrations, than the real danger from the armed forces was
able to inspire. But Suetonius, exhorting his troops to disregard the menaces
of a superstition which he despised, impelled them to the attack, drove
the Britons off the field, burned the Druids in the same fires which those


<span class="sidenote">The Druids
burnt in the
fires they had
prepared for
their enemies.</span>


priests had prepared for their captive enemies; destroyed all their consecrated
groves and altars&mdash;and having thus triumphed over the religion of
the Britons, he thought his future progress would be easy in reducing the
people to subjection; but in this expectation he was disappointed. The
circumference of the island is seventy-six miles. The sea-passage from
Holyhead to Dublin, is about sixty miles, which is now traversed by steam
packets daily. Next to agriculture, and the rearing of cattle, mining
affords most employment to the labouring population; a great number of
persons are also engaged in fishing and catching wild-fowl, round the coast.
It comprises 200,000 acres of land.</p>

a gentleman of large property, and one of the representatives of the county,
at the commencement of the civil wars, being averse to the measures of the
court, and having been intrusted by Parliament with the command of St.

possession; but the design being discovered to the Parliament, he was
suddenly seized and carried prisoner to Plymouth, and there the women
were so enraged against him, that it was with difficulty he was rescued
from their vengeance. From thence he was conveyed by sea to London,
where he was expelled by the Commons, and being tried by a court-martial,
was found guilty and beheaded on Tower Hill, December 23, 1644. <span class="smcap">West
Anthony</span>, or St. Jacobs. This is a very pleasing village, which has risen
into importance from its proximity to the towns of Devonport, Plymouth
and Stonehouse; it is a favourite residence of the officers connected with
the dockyards and navy at these important towns. Near this place is
Mount Edgecomb, the residence of the Earl of that title; it is celebrated
for the beauty of its situation, near the sea, and being a much admired stroll
for the inhabitants of, and visitors to Plymouth.</p>



<p>[C] APPLEBY is situate on the river Ancholme, which rises in
the wolds near Market Raisin, whence, it takes a northerly direction near
Glandford Bridge, it is navigable to the Humber for barges of small burden.
That very ancient British road&mdash;the Ermine-street&mdash;passes through the
village. This line of road was afterwards adopted by the Romans; it
enters the county to the west of Stamford, and preserving nearly a due
northerly direction, passing through the city of Lincoln, continues its
course to the banks of the Humber; it is cast up to a great height, and is
in some places seven yards in breadth.</p>

<p>[A] APPLEBY, a populous village, which connects the four counties of
Leicester, Derby, Stafford, and Warwick. Here is a free grammar school
for 100 boys, founded by Sir John Moore, in 1697.</p>


<p>[B] APPLEBY. This town is situated on the river Eden, by which it is
almost surrounded, and by some antiquaries it is supposed to occupy
the site of the Roman station Aballaba. It has been the county town
since the reign of Edward the Confessor. It is governed by a Mayor,
Aldermen, and capital Burgesses; the Mayor having authority to arrest
for any sum without limitation. Appleby did send two representatives
to Parliament, but has been disfranchised by the Reform Bill. It has
many times been assailed by the Scots, who burnt it in 1388; and in 1598 it


<span class="sidenote">Burnt by the
Scots.</span>


suffered seriously by a pestilence, from which time it has never recovered
its former size and consequence. The town at present consists of one broad
street, built irregularly on the slope of a hill, at the upper part of which
stands the castle, which is of early Norman, if not of Saxon origin; and at the
lower end the parish church. The ancient market houses or cloisters, were
pulled down in 1811, and a handsome gothic building, erected by Smirke, in
their stead. Here are also a town-hall and gaol; and at each end of the
town stands a stone obelisk or cross. Appleby received charters from Hen.
II., John, and Hen. III., all which were given up to James II., since which
period it has subsisted as a borough by prescription. Crackenthorpe Hall,
a manorial residence in this parish, was from the earliest period of authenticated
record, the mansion of the Machels, a Saxon family, who eventually
alienated it to the late Earl of Lonsdale. Near this seat, which is at
present neglected, is a Roman camp 300 yards long and 150 yards broad,
with three entrances, and a watch tower or fort, at the distance of bow-shot.
Appleby has produced some eminent characters, among whom should be
noticed Thomas de Veripont, Bishop of Carlisle, in 1255. Thomas de
Appleby, Bishop of Carlisle, in 1363. Roger de Appleby, Bishop of Ossory,


<span class="sidenote">Eminent
characters

in 1404; and Dr. Christopher Potter, Provost of Queen's College,
Oxford, Prebendary of Windsor, and Dean of Worcester; the last named was
vice-chancellor of Oxford when the civil wars of Charles I. broke out, and
sent all his plate to the king, stating that he would drink as Diogenes did,
from the hollow of his hand, before his majesty should want. Here is a
free Grammar School, richly endowed, which is open to all the children
of the town upon paying 2s. 6d. per quarter to the Master; and also five
scholarships, founded by the Earl of Thanet at Queen's College, Oxford,
and entitled to participate in five exhibitions of &pound;60. per annum at the
same college, on the foundation of Lady Elizabeth Hastings. An Hospital
for thirteen widows, founded by the celebrated Anne, Countess of Pembroke
and Montgomery, heiress of the Cliffords, the possessors of the
castle for several centuries; by the marriage of whose eldest daughter it
became the property of the family of Tufton, Earl of Thanet. The main
portion of the present castle which is of a square form, was built in 1686
out of the ruins of a part of the former, by Thomas, Earl of Thanet. Appleby
Castle survived the attacks of the Parliamentary Army, under the


<span class="sidenote">Appleby
castle.</span>


influence of its owner, the aforesaid Countess Anne, but was compelled to
yield in 1648. The church of St. Lawrence, which was partly built by
the same spirited lady, contains a noble monument to her memory. The
market is one of the best supplied with corn in its vicinity. It however
possesses but little trade, and no manufacture of importance.</p>

of Metals; and wrote a work, the object of which is to prove,

He commenced a war with the College of Physicians, by accusing them of
deceit and ignorance, and published a translation of their "Dispensary,"
giving an account of the supposed virtues of each drug, and the complaints
in which they were used. He was also author of the "Herbal," which
is written with much clearness, and distinctly explained. It passed
through many editions. From the tenor of his writings, it may be gathered
that he joined or at least favoured the Jesuits.</p>

[C] ARDSLEY. The birth place of James Nayler, a Quaker, who was


remarkable both on account of the extravagance of the delusions which for

<span class="sidenote">J. Nayler,
the Quaker,
a remarkable
fanatic;</span>

some time possessed him and his followers, and the excessive severity of
the punishment which was inflicted upon him. He was the son of an
industrious little farmer, who supported his family by the cultivation of
his own estate. About the age of twenty-two he married, and removed
into the parish of Wakefield, where he continued till the breaking out
of the civil wars in 1641. He then entered into the parliament army,
and served as a soldier eight or nine years, at first under Lord Fairfax, and


<span class="sidenote">becomes a
soldier.</span>


afterwards as quarter-master in major-general Lambert's troop in Scotland;
till, being disabled by sickness, he returned home about the year
1649. At this time he was a member of the Independent party, and continued
so till the year 1651, when the preaching of George Fox made him
a convert to the communion of the Quakers, as they are called. Among
them he soon commenced preacher, and, according to their judgment, acquitted
himself well both in speaking and writing.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the following year he imagined he heard a voice,
calling upon him to renounce his kindred and his father's house, and go
into the west, promising that God would be with him. In obedience to
this voice, which he believed to be the voice of God, he went about preaching
from place to place, and greatly increased the numbers of the new sect.
Towards the close of the year 1654, or early in 1655, he came to London,
where he found a meeting of Friends which had been established by
Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill, among whom he so greatly distinguished
himself by his preaching, that many drew invidious comparisons
between him and his brethren, which created uneasiness and differences in
the society. To such a length did these proceed, that some women, admirers
of Nayler, assumed the liberty of interrupting and disputing with
Howgill and Burrough in the midst of their preachings, and thus disturbed
the peace of the meetings. For this conduct they were reproved by these
preachers; upon which they complained so loudly and passionately to
Nayler, that he was weak enough to take their part, and was so intoxicated
with their flattering praises, that he became estranged from his best
friends, who strongly disapproved of and lamented his conduct. In the
year 1658 we find him in Devonshire, where he was committed to Exeter


<span class="sidenote">Committed
to Exeter
Jail for
blasphemy.</span>


jail for propagating his opinions. Here he received letters from some of
his female admirers and others, written in the most extravagant strains,
calling him the everlasting Son of righteous&mdash;the Prince of peace&mdash;the
only begotten Son of God&mdash;the fairest among ten thousand, &amp;c., and some
of his followers kneeled before him in the prison, and kissed his feet. It
is but justice, however, to the Quakers in general to mention, that they
had now disowned Nayler and his adherents.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Nayler was released from imprisonment, and intended
to return to London, but, taking Bristol in his way, as he passed through
Glastonbury and Wells, his deluded attendants strewed their garments
before him. When they came to Bedminster, about a mile from Bristol,


<span class="sidenote">Extravagant
conduct of
his admirers.</span>


they carried their extravagance to the highest pitch; for they formed a
procession in imitation of our Saviour's entrance into Jerusalem, in which
a man walked bare-headed before Nayler, and a woman led his horse,
while other women spread their scarfs and hankerchiefs in the road, and
the company sung, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; Hosanna
in the highest! holy, holy is the Lord God of Israel!" In this manner
these mad people made their entrance into Bristol, marching through
the mire and dirt, to the amazement of some, and the diversion of others;
but the magistrates thought proper to interfere, and, after what had passed,
committed them to prison. Soon afterwards they were sent to London
and a committee was appointed by parliament to examine witnesses against
Nayler, upon a charge of blasphemy, for admitting religious worship to be
paid ti him, and for assuming the names and incommunicable titles
and attributes of our blessed Saviour. Before the committee, he did not
deny what was alleged concerning the extraordinary proceeding in Exeter
jail, and at his entrance into Bristol; while defending himself by maintaining
that the honours which he received were not shown to him, but to
Christ who dwelt within him; and if they were offered to any other than
to Christ, he disowned them.</p>

<p>However, the committee having made a report to the house on the fifth
of December, declaring the charge well founded, on the following day he
was sent for, and heard at the bar; and on the eighth they resolved that
"James Nayler is guilty of horrid blasphemy, and that he is a grand impostor,


<span class="sidenote">Condemned
by the House
of Commons
for blasphemy.</span>


and a great seducer of the people." The next business to be determined
on was, the nature of the punishment to be inflicted on him; which
occupied the debate of the house, both on forenoons and afternoons, till
the 16th of December, many members being for putting him to death,
(and losing their vote, as secretary Thurloe informs us, only by fourteen
voices,) while many other members totally disapproved of the severity
which was used against him. At length, on the following day, after a
considerable debate, the majority came to the resolution, "That James
Nayler be set in the pillory, in the Palace-yard, Westminster, during the
space of two hours, on Thursday next; and be whipt by the hangman
through the streets from Westminster to the Old Exchange, and there likewise
be set with his head in the pillory, for the space of two hours, between
the hours of eleven and one on Saturday next; in each place wearing


<span class="sidenote">Cruel sentence&mdash;his
tongue bored
with a hot
iron.</span>


a paper, containing an inscription of his crimes: And that at the Old
Exchange, his tongue be bored through with a hot iron; and that he
be there also stigmatized in the forehead with the letter B: That he
be afterwards sent to Bristol, and be conveyed into and through the
said city on horseback, with his face backward, and there also publicly
whipt the next market-day after he comes thither: And that from thence
he be committed to prison in Bridewell, London, and there to labour hard
till he be released by parliament; and, during that time, be debarred the
use of pen, ink, and paper, and shall have no relief but what he earns by
his daily labour."</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of December, the first part of it was carried into
execution with the greatest rigour; but he was brought into a state of
such extreme weakness by his cruel whipping, that, upon repeated applications
to the parliament, his punishment was respited for one week. The


<span class="sidenote">His punishment
respited</span>


Protector was then addressed, and wrote a letter to the house, which,
though it occasioned some debate, obtained no resolution in favour of the
prisoner. On this the petitioners presented a second address to Cromwell;
but, it is said the influence of the ministers prevented its effect.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh of December, the remainder of Nayler's sentence
was executed at the Old Exchange. Afterwards he was sent to Bristol,
where he was publicly whipt, from the middle of Thomas-street, over the
bridge to Broad-street. From Bristol, he was brought back to Bridewell,
London, where he was confined about two years; during which his mind
recovered from the frenzy which had governed it, and he felt deep humiliation
and sincere repentance on account of his past conduct.</p>

<p>After the protector's death, Nayler was released from prison, and went
to Bristol, where, in a public meeting, he made a confession of his offence


<span class="sidenote">His contrition
and
death.</span>


and fall, in a manner so affecting as to draw tears from most of those who
were present, and having afforded satisfactory evidence of his unfeigned
contrition, was again received into the communion of his friends.</p>

<p>Nayler did not long survive his enlargement, for having left London in
October 1660, with the intention of going home to his wife and children
at Wakefield, he was taken ill in Huntingdonshire, where, it is said, he
was robbed and left bound in a field. Whether he received any personal
injury is not known, but being found towards evening by a countryman,
he was carried to a friend's house, at Holm, near King's Ripon, where he
expired in the month of December, when about 44 years of age. The expressions
uttered by him about two hours before his death, both in justice
to his name, which is so conspicuous in the history of the reveries of the
human imagination, and on account of their own excellence, ought not to
be omitted in the memoirs of his life.</p>

<p>"There is a spirit which I feel," said he, "that delights to do no evil,
nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hopes to
enjoy its own in the end. Its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention,
and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatever is of a nature
contrary to itself. It sees to the end of all temptation: as it bears no evil
in itself, so it conceives none in thoughts to any other. If it be betrayed,
it bears it, for its ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness of God.
Its crown is meekness, its life is everlasting love unfeigned, and takes its
kingdom with entreaty and not with contention, and keeps it by lowliness
of mind."</p>

<p>His writings were collected together, and published in an octavo
volume in 1716.</p>

<p>[B] ARLSEY, or ARSLEY. This village was anciently a market
town. In "Doomsday Book," (a book made by order of William the
Conqueror, in which all the estates of the kingdom were registered;)
its market on Wednesday is recorded, and the tolls valued at 10s. per annum.
A fair was held here so long past as the year 1270; but both the
market and fair have long been disused. An ancient entrenchment near

the road to Baldock, called Etonbury, was probably the original site of
the castle occupied by the Lords of the Manor. This castle appears to have
a place of considerable strength. Amongst the ancient monuments
in the church is one erected to the memory of Richard Edwards, who is
called on his epitaph, the last Grand Reader of the Temple.</p>


<p>[C] ARMATHWAITE. Near this village is a castle, situated on the
of the delightful river Eden, in a deep vale; the building from
its monastic gloom, appears rather to have been calculated for seclusion
than security. The front has been modernized, and is built of hewn stone.
Its antiquity has not been ascertained, certain it is the Skeltons resided
here as early as the reign of Henry VIII. The most romantic and picturesque
scenery surrounds this lovely spot. A magnificent hill throws its
solemn shade on the tranquil surface of the river, here broadened into a
lake like form. Amongst other grand masses of rock is a projecting crag


<span class="sidenote">Rendezvous
of wild cats</span>


of a bold and grotesque form called the Cat Glent, the rendezvous of many
wild inhabitants of the feline tribe; beyond these is a mill and a few sequestered
cottages. From this spot the river Eden is no longer tranquil, but
rushing down a cataract pours in sonorous violence over a bed of opposing
rock, whose immovable crags whirl the stream into eddies as it passes them
in its fury. Near this place a nunnery was established by William Rufus,

who like other profligates, "trembled amidst his impiety," and was willing
enough to secure a chance of heaven, provided it could be obtained by
any other means than virtuous practice. At the dissolution of Monasteries,
owing to the frequent hostilities between the Scots and English,
their income amounted to only 18 guineas per annum.</p>



<p>[D] ARMITAGE is situated on the river Soar, in the hundred of Offlow,
South, including the hamlet of Handsacre. The entrance to the church is
very curiously built in the Saxon style, and the chapel is separated from
the nave by a handsome arch. The Grand Trunk Canal passes through a

Canal, and of the river Aire, on which there are a number of mills
employed in various branches of the clothing trade. An object once of
great antiquarian curiosity, called Giants Hill, which was a Danish fortification,
is now scarcely traceable, in consequence of its having been cut
through to form the Leeds and Liverpool canal.</p>

<p>[A] ARRINGTON. This village was anciently called Ermington. It is
near Lord Hardwicke's Park. At this place, in the year 1721, the skeletons
of sixteen human bodies were found in digging for a water course,


<span class="sidenote">Sixteen
skeletons
found here.</span>


within two feet of the surface of the ground. Some pieces of iron much
rusted, conjectured to have been pieces of swords were also found. It is
supposed the skeletons were the remains of persons who had been killed in
endeavouring to obtain possession of the pass over the river Cam, during
the civil wars.</p>


<p>[B] ARTHURET. This village is situated on a point of land which in
early times was said to have been called Arthur's Head, from whence the
name is derived. In this place was both born and buried, Archibald Armstrong,
Jester to both King James I., and Charles I. By an incident suitable
to his profession, his funeral took place on "All Fools Day," the


<span class="sidenote">A merry jester

first of April. He was banished the court for speaking too freely of
Archbishop Laud's measure of introducing the Liturgy into Scotland,
which had produced a considerable tumult. On the arrival of the news
of these riots in England, Archy facetiously asked his grace, "Who's the
fool now." The joke was bitterly resented by the prelate, who procured
an order of council to banish him from the court, for speaking disrespectful
words of the Archbishop of Canterbury. This parish is bounded partly by
Solway Frith, and forms part of the debateable lands so celebrated in Scottish
history; these lands and the celebrated Solway Moss, we shall have
occasion to speak further of in the course of the work.</p>


<p>[C] ARUNDEL, is situated on the declivity of a hill, on the north bank of
the river Arun, over which there is a bridge. It consists of two principal
streets, one of which runs north and south, and the other westward from the
point of the union. Many of the houses are built in the castellated style.
The church, situated at the north end of the town, originally belonged to
a priory of Benedictines, and is supposed to have been founded soon after
the conquest of Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Arundel. It is a handsome
gothic building with transepts, from the centre of which rises a
square tower, with a wooden spire. Some beautiful monuments of


<span class="sidenote">Beautiful

the Earls of Arundel may be seen; and one, more magnificent than
the rest, is of alabaster, a calcareous earth, which differs from marble,
in being combined not with carbonic, but with sulphuric acid. This
monument is erected to the memory of Thomas Fitz-Alan, and Beatrice,
his countess, a daughter of John, King of Portugal. The charter by
which the town is governed, was granted by Queen Elizabeth. It formerly
sent two members, but by the Reform Bill, it now sends but one;
the ten pound householders are calculated at 380. The borough comprises
the parish of Arundel and the returning officer is the mayor. Here was
formerly a harbour sufficient to contain vessels of one hundred tons
burthen, but it has suffered great damage by the sea. Great quantities of

trade, yet it is much benefitted in summer by the numerous visitors who
resort to it for sea bathing. Of the castle, which stands on the north-east
side of the town, mention is first made in the will of King Alfred,
who bequeathed it, with the town, to his nephew Adhelm. A popular


<span class="sidenote">Tradition
ascribes the
foundation
of the castle
to a giant.</span>


tradition ascribes the foundation of it to Beris, "a giant of ancient
times," in confirmation of which opinion a tower is still pointed out,
called Beris Tower. The Conqueror gave it to his kinsman Roger
de Montgomery, whom he also created Earl of Arundel, which title
belonged to three persons of this family, till Robert Bellesme was outlawed
by Henry I. for the assistance he gave to that monarch's brother,
Robert. The castle was then settled on Queen Adeliza, who, after the
death of her royal consort, gave her hand to William de Albini, one of the
most accomplished men of his age. Here the dowager-queen performed
the rites of hospitality towards the Empress Maud, in the attempt of that
princess to ascend the throne. The last male heir of the name of Albini,
died in 1243, when the castle and manor of Arundel fell to his sister,
Isabel, whose husband, John Fitz-Alan, made the castle his residence, and
assumed the title of Earl of Arundel. The fourth in descent from him forfeited
his life and estates, in the attempt to ruin the Despensers, favourites


<span class="sidenote">The king

of Edward II.; but the estates were restored to his son, whose successor,
in the reign of Richard II., being accused of a conspiracy to seize the king,
and put to death the lords of the council, was beheaded; the king presiding
at the execution. His son, Thomas Fitz-Alan, was reinstated by Henry
IV.; but, he dying without issue, in 1415, the castle devolved to his
cousin, Sir John Fitz-Alan, who laid claim to, and obtained the title, on
which an act was passed, that the possession of this castle and honour
conferred the dignity of Earl without creation. The last Fitz-Alan died
in the 22d of Elizabeth, leaving a daughter, who married Thomas Howard,
Duke of Norfolk, thus carrying the earldom and estate into that family,
to whom they still belong.</p>

<p>Concerning the true period of the foundation of this castle, many conjectures
have been entertained. On account of the bricks inserted in the
walls of the keep, it has been attributed to the Romans; but such a proof

<span class="sidenote">The great
antiquity of
the castle.</span>

is not allowed by the best antiquaries. Its pretensions to the era of the
Saxon kings are more explicit. The more ancient parts are the keep or
citadel, and the towers which flank the gateway, and connect the whole
by means of a sally port. The keep stands upon an artificial mound, the
height of which, from the fosse, is one hundred and ten feet on one side,
and eighty on the other. Of its external wall, the height is thirty feet,
supported by projecting ribs or buttresses. It is eight feet thick, with a
wall on the inside, guarded by a parapet as many feet high. The diameter
of the room which is faced with Norman or Caen stone, is sixty-seven feet
by fifty-nine. There are also Roman bricks placed in the herring-bone
fashion, which is observable in most Saxon buildings. In the centre is a
subterraneous room and passage; and in a tower attached to the keep, is a
well three hundred feet deep. The approach is by a time-worn staircase,
and over a narrow pass, commanding the entrance to the building, which
bears the marks of a portcullis. The more ancient one towards the east
still retains a very rich Saxon door-case. In the tower above the present
entrance, was a small chapel or oratory, dedicated to St. George. The


<span class="sidenote">The castle
dungeons of
remarkable depth.</span>


tower and gateway facing the base court of the castle are apparently co-temporary
with the keep. The other towers are built with flint. The
dungeons are on the right and left of the gateway. They consist of eight
wards, protected by a draw-bridge from the castle moat. The lower wards
are very deep, and partly filled up with rubbish. The foundation walls of
these dungeons are not known, although efforts have been employed to
discover the length and depth of these frightful abodes. The Empress
Maud's apartments are in the tower, above the old gateway. They consist
of three bed-rooms. The Saxon keep may justly be termed the ivy-mantled
tower, for the walls are literally covered with its leaves. The late
Duke of Norfolk was very partial to this retired spot. Here are several
remarkably curious owls, elegant, and extremely large; some of them


<span class="sidenote">Remarkable
owls</span>


measuring across the wings, from eight to ten feet. Their plumage is particularly
beautiful, and their eyes brilliant. The late duke purchased them
from North America. There are many traces of ancient remains about
the keep or tower. The spot where the boilers stood, for the purpose of
melting the lead to pour down upon the besiegers, and those used for
culinary purposes, are still visible. The marks of cannon balls discharged
against the tower during the siege of the parliamentary forces, are observable
in many places. The ground plan of the present castle nearly
resembles that of Windsor Castle, in the exact proportion of nine to fourteen.
When the late Duke of Norfolk took possession, the castle was
little better than a heap of ruins, but his Grace has restored it to its
original magnificence. The building is of free-stone, from the quarries in
Yorkshire; and those of a brown cast were carefully selected, in order that
they might assimilate in colour with the old remains. The new walls have


<span class="sidenote">The late
Duke of
Norfolk restored
the castle to its
ancient
magnificence.</span>


risen upon the ancient model, and correspond with the old ones in solidity
of fabric, as well as dignity of ornament. An entire new front of massy
stone, which differs materially from the others, particularly in exhibiting
the insignia of the Howards, mixed with those of their predecessors, and
two colossal figures of liberty and hospitality, ornament the grand entrance.
In raising this front, the late duke had the opportunity of enlarging
the mansion, and gaining the space now occupied on the basement
story, by a long range of servants' offices, including a new kitchen, with
two fire places, bake-house, scullery, the steward's and housekeeper's
rooms, &amp;c. The cellars are of immense length. The duke weekly
employed from 100 to 200 labourers, mechanics, and artists, in the improvement
and decorations of this noble edifice, for upwards of twenty-five


<span class="sidenote">Employed
from 100 to

years. The arrangements were formed entirely from his own ideas, and
in the progress of the plan, he was exclusively his own architect. On the
west wing is a beautiful sculptured basso relievo historical representation
of King Alfred receiving the report of the jury, as established in his reign.
The costume and draperies are finely carved in stone. The interior of the
castle is fitted up with great taste and effect. The richest mahogany has
been used in almost every decoration. The walls being more than six feet
thick, form a kind of frame for each window, which is five feet deep on the
inside, and the whole of this spacious case is lined with mahogany. The
window frames which hold the magnificent plate glass panes, three feet
each in height, are of the same material; and the solid mahogany doors
are held in cases of the thickness of the inner walls, perhaps, four feet
deep, all lined with pannels of the richest grain.</p>



<p>In the Barons room the following inscription appears:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
"CHARLES HOWARD, DUKE OF NORFOLK,
<br />
EARL OF ARUNDEL,
<br />
in the year of Christ, 1806,<br />

in the reign of John."

<p>On the 15th of June, 1815, a great festival took place for celebrating the
centenary of the signing of Magna Charta. There was a splendid assemblage
of the nobility and persons of distinction. Complete suits of ancient

armour, with swords and spears, forged in ancient times, and for very
different purposes, were either suspended from, or hung around the walls;
and every adventitious aid was adopted to give state and majesty to this
celebration of the magnanimous conduct of the Barons of England. Nearly
three hundred distinguished guests sat down. The head of the table was
ornamented with a noble baron of beef, surmounted by the ducal coronet,
and the banners of the illustrious house of Norfolk.</p>

<p>The castle occupies a mile in circumference, and the beautiful domains
which surround this magnificent structure, are more than seven miles and

a half in circumference, enclosed with a strong fence railing. The grounds
are well laid out, in gardens, shrubberies, and plantations. There are
three agreeable towers in the park; High Horn, commanding an extensive
prospect; and Mount Pleasant, covered with ivy, overlooking
the beautiful vale of Sussex. The late duke built another tower, facing
the road to Petworth, called the White Ways. The castle is open to the
inspection of visitors on the first Sunday in the month after divine service,
and on every Monday in the year.</p>

<p>When the buildings on the Norfolk estate adjoining the Strand, London,
were erected, it was legally settled, that the whole of the rents, should be expended


<span class="sidenote">Estates in
London devoted
to keep it in

for the sole purpose of keeping up Arundel Castle; this has always
been acted upon. The original rents having long since fallen in&mdash;and the increased
income that has been produced by that cause, joined to the general
increase of rents in that quarter, has been so great, that it now requires
very great ingenuity to contrive the means of laying out all that money
according to the directions of the original entail; and this is the real cause
of the magnificent style in which that ancient baronial castle is still supported.
The estate thus mentioned, comprises the whole of Surrey-street,
Arundel-street, Howard-street, and Norfolk-street, which are the entire
property of the Norfolk family.</p>

<p>[A] ST. ASAPH. This city is seated on the decline of a pleasant eminence,
between the rivers Clwyd and Elwy, which renders the first appearance
striking, though it contains little more than one street. The church stands
in the lower part of the town, and serves for the use of the parishioners,
the cathedral not being used for parochial purposes; the latter was built
about the close of the fifteenth century; it consists of a choir, a nave, two
aisles, and a transept. During the protectorship of Cromwell the palace
and cathedral were much injured by the post-master, who made great havoc


<span class="sidenote">The font of

in the choir of the cathedral, using the font as a trough for watering his
horses; and by way of venting his spleen on the clergy, tied up calves in
the bishop's throne. Several very eminent men have been bishops of
St. Asaph, including Dr. Isaac Barrow, William Beveridge, and Samuel
Horsley, the former of whom founded an alms-house for eight poor widows.
Bishop Hughes, who died 1600, founded, and endowed the Free Grammar
School. The neighbourhood possesses several land proprietors who have
given great encouragement to agriculture, amongst whom may be included
Dean Shipley, who stimulated the practical farmers to emulation, by premiums,
and other encouragement. To this spirited dignitary, so well
known in the history of the law of libel, a very handsome monument has
been erected in the cathedral.</p>

<p>[B] ASBY, once called Askeby. This parish consists of four manors. The
church is ancient, its beauty has been much disfigured by repairs; it
has even been diminished in size, as appears by an arch now filled up in
the north wall. At Sayle Bottom are several tumuli&mdash;some circular,
others rectangular. At Garthorne Hall, a tumulus was found to contain
human bones and a large sword, and another containing three entire
skulls. Pate Hole, in this parish, is a remarkable cavern in a limestone rock,


<span class="sidenote">Pate Hole,

consisting of two galleries, one 430 yards long, towards the north east,
the other, 230 yards long, making a large sweep from the extremity
of the first to its middle; together, they resemble the letter P. At the
end of the first gallery is a lofty dome, and a pool 20 yards long, 6 broad,
and 3 deep; and in the second are two perpendicular chasms of unknown
extent, from whence proceed in rainy seasons torrents of water, which
fill the cavern and discharge themselves from its entrance. The noise of
these operations resemble at first gentle music, but increases to the pitch
of the loudest. In one part is a petrifying spring, which always stands
at one temperature.</p>

<p>[A] ASHE is situated in Musbury parish, which lies in the hundred of Axminster,
two miles east by north from Colyton. It is the birth place of
the celebrated John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough: this distinguished


<span class="sidenote">The birth-place

erson was born here in the year 1650. He received only an indifferent
education, for his father took him to court at the age of twelve years, when
he became page, as his sister, Arabella, became mistress to the Duke of
York. In 1660, he obtained a pair of colours in the Guards. His first
service was at the siege of Tangier, and, on his return from thence, he
became the favourite of the Duchess of Cleveland, who gave him &pound;5,000
with which he purchased an annuity for life. He afterwards served under
the great Turenne, who was so pleased with his person and bravery as to
call him the handsome Englishman. At the siege of Maestricht he so distinguished
himself, that the King of France publicly thanked him. On his
return he was made lieutenant-colonel, gentleman of the bedchamber, and
master of the robes to the Duke of York, whom he attended to Holland
and Scotland; and about this time married Miss Jennings, maid of honour
to the Princess, afterwards Queen Anne. In 1682, he was shipwrecked
with the Duke of York, in their passage to Scotland, on which occasion
his royal highness expressed the greatest anxiety to save his favourite.
The same year he was made a peer, by the title of Baron Eymouth, in
Scotland; and when James came to the crown, he was sent to France to
notify the event. In 1685, he was created Lord Churchill, of Sandridge.
The same year he suppressed Monmouth's rebellion, and took him prisoner.


<span class="sidenote">He took
Monmouth
prisoner in
the reign of
James II.</span>


He continued to serve James with great fidelity, till the arrival of the
Prince of Orange, and then left him, for which he has been stigmatized,
and perhaps not unjustly, with base ingratitude. His own apology was a
regard for the religion and constitution of his country. He was created
Earl of Marlborough by King William in 1689, and appointed commander
of the English army in the low countries. He next served in Ireland, and
reduced Cork, with other strong places. In 1692, he was suddenly dismissed
from his employments, and committed to the Tower: he was, however,
very soon released, but the cause of this disgrace was never clearly
explained. After the death of Queen Mary he was restored to favour;
and at the close of that reign he had the command of the English forces in
Holland, and the States chose him captain-general of their forces. On the
commencement of the reign of Anne, he recommended a war with France,
and his advice was adopted. In the first campaign of 1702, he took a
number of strong towns, particularly Liege. In the following year he


<span class="sidenote">Created a
Duke by

was created a Duke. In 1704, he joined Prince Eugene, in conjunction
with whom he conquered the French at Hochstedt, took Marshal Tallard
prisoner, and brought him to England, with 26 other officers of rank,
121 standards, and 179 colours. He then received the grant of the manor
of Woodstock. In 1706, he fought the famous battle of Ramilies. This
battle accelerated the fall of Louvain, Brussels, and other important places.
He arrived in England, and received fresh honours from the Queen and Parliament.


<span class="sidenote">Blenheim

Blenheim house was ordered to be built, and a pension of &pound;5,000.
a year was awarded him. In 1709, he defeated Marshal Villars at Malplaquet.
In the year 1711, he returned to England with additional laurels,
but was soon after dismissed from his employments. To add to this unjust
treatment, a prosecution was commenced against him for applying the
public money to his private purposes. Indignant at such conduct, he went
into voluntary banishment till 1714, when he landed at Dover, amidst the
acclamations of the people. George I. restored him to his military employments,
but he retired from his appointments to Windsor, and died in 1722.
His remains were interred with great pomp in Westminster Abbey. His

Duchess outlived him several years. She was a woman of a strong mind,
but overbearing passions. Her letters have been printed, and display
uncommon sagacity, blended with a great share of vanity. The mansion
house in which the Duke was born, now in a state of ruin, was rebuilt
shortly after the civil wars, by Sir John Drake, whose daughter had
married Sir Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>[A] ASHBOURN is very pleasantly situated in a rich valley on the
eastern side of the Dove, over which is a stone bridge. It is divided into
two parts by a rivulet, which is called Henmore, the southern part of
which is termed Compton, the ancient Campdene. From the descent of
the hill on the Derby road, the view of the place as it presents itself embosomed
amongst the hills is beautifully picturesque. It is a neat town, but
there is nothing remarkable in its buildings. At the time of the conquest
it was a royal manor, and subsequently became a part of the Duchy of


<span class="sidenote">A royal

Lancaster, until it was sold by Charles I. It is supposed that the church,
which is dedicated to St. Oswald, was finished in the thirteenth century;
in it are many monuments to the Cockaines, Bradburns, and Boothby's,
successively possessors of the manors. Sir Thomas Cockaine and other
natives, founded a Free Grammar School, in the reign of Elizabeth, for
children of the town and neighbourhood, and also a second for the poorer
class of children of both sexes. Here are also a chapel and a neat row of
alms-houses, founded in 1800 by a native named Cooper, who made a
fortune in London, for six poor men and women, and several other hospitals
for decayed house-keepers, including one for the maintenance of
four clergymen's widows. A very considerable trade is carried on here in
cheese and malt, many horses and cattle are sold at its fairs. Much lace
is made here, and a great many persons are employed in the iron and
cotton factories in the neighbourhood. The romantic and beautiful glen
of Dovedale is within a short distance. This town is one of the polling
places for the southern division of the county.</p>

<p>[A] ASHBURNHAM is in the hundred of Foxearle, and rape of Hastings.
This village gives the name and title of Earl to the representatives of the
ancient family of Ashburnham, who possessed this manor before the conquest.

on the 30th of January, 1649, and also the watch which he gave
to Mr. John Ashburnham, on the scaffold, are still preserved in the church,
having been bequeathed by one of his descendants to the clerk of this
parish for ever, and are exhibited as great curiosities.</p>



<p>[B] ASHBURTON is situated in a valley encompassed by hills; it is about
a mile from the river Dart, and consists principally of one long street,
through which runs the high road from London to Plymouth. The houses
are neat, and most of them covered with slate, of which there is abundance
in the vicinity. The manor belonged to the crown in the reign of James I.,
but it has since passed through various private hands. The town, which
is governed by a portreeve, chosen at the court leet and baron of the
manor, is a borough by prescription, (that is to say, a custom continued
until it has the force of law;) and was constituted one of the four stannary

once subsequently until 1640, in which year its privilege was
restored: by the late reform bill, it now returns but one member; the
electors on the old constituency were 101, and &pound;10 householders 342.
The portreeve is the returning-officer. The borough comprises the parish
of Ashburton.</p>

<p>[C] ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCH is situated in a fertile valley on the borders
of Derbyshire, through which runs the small river Gilwiskaw. Its distinctive
appellation is derived from the ancient family of the Zouches, who
came into possession of the manor in the reign of Henry III. It afterwards


<span class="sidenote">An ancient
family gave
their name

devolved to the crown, by which it was granted to the noble family
of Hastings, in right of whom the Marquis of that title still possesses it.
The town is chiefly comprised in one street, from which branches several
smaller ones. The church is a handsome ancient edifice, built of stone,
consisting of a nave and two aisles, separated by four lofty arches, springing
from fluted pillars. Here are also places of worship for the Calvinistic
and Wesleyan Methodists, Presbyterians, and others. A free
grammar school was founded in this town by Henry Earl of Huntingdon,
in 1567; and another free school for 26 boys, by Isaac Dawson, in 1669.
The manufactures established here are chiefly those of cotton and woollen
stockings, and hats. There is also a good trade in malt, and the fairs are celebrated
for the sale of fine horses and cattle. The mansion at Ashby was

favourite of Edward IV., who was elevated by that monarch to several
offices of high trust and dignity. It stood on a rising ground, at the
south end of the town, and was composed of brick and stone from the ruins
of Ashby Castle.</p>

<p>[A] ASHBY PUERORUM. In the year 1804, a Roman sepulchre was
discovered near this place, by a labourer who was cutting a ditch. It consisted
of a stone chest, which laid 3 feet below the surface of the earth; the lid
fitted nearly to the sides, hanging a little over the edge, so that when it was
removed; no dirt of any kind was found to have gained admittance during
a period of nearly two thousand years. The chest was formed of free stone,
of a kind found in abundance on Lincoln Heath. The urn was of strong glass


<span class="sidenote">A very ancient
urn of
green glass
found here.</span>


well manufactured, and of a greenish colour. The glass was as perfect and
the surface as smooth as if just taken out of the fire. This receptacle of
the ashes was nearly filled with small pieces of bone, many of which, from
the effect of ignition, were white throughout the whole substance. Among
the fragments was discovered a small lacrymatory, which had been broken,
from the curiosity of the person who discovered it, to ascertain whether it
contained any thing of value.</p>


<p>[B] ASHBY ST. LEDGER is situated near a rivulet that flows into the river
Nen. The additional name of St. Ledger is borrowed from the patron
saint to whom the church is dedicated. This structure consists of a nave
and aisles, with a tower and spire. At the upper end of the north aisle are
still remaining the steps which led to the rude loft between the chancel
and the nave. Here are three piscinas for holy water. Several ancient
monumental inscriptions may be seen in the chancel. On an altar
tomb within the communion rails, are the recumbent figures of a
man and woman, with an inscription in black letter, commemorative of


<span class="sidenote">An ancient
monument of the Catesby
family.</span>


William Catesby and Margaret his wife, bearing date 1493. Catesby was
one of the three families who ruled the nation under Richard's usurpation,
and constituted the triumvirate which is alluded to in the old distich:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
The rat, and the cat, and Lovel the dog,<br />
Do govern all England under the hog.
</p>

<p>The rat was Richard Ratcliff, the cat William Catesby, the dog Lord Lovel,
and the hog for Richard, it being then the regal crest. William Catesby
became a distinguished character; he was made esquire of the King's
body; Chancellor of the Marshes for life; and one of the Chamberlains of
the Exchequer. Being taken prisoner at the battle of Bosworth field,


<span class="sidenote">Catesby

while fighting by his patron's side, he was conducted to Leicester, and
beheaded as a traitor. At the eastern end of both aisles, are two places,
formerly appropriated as places of sepulture for the two great Lords of
Ashby. One of these belonged to the Catesby family; but most of the
inscriptions are effaced. The manorial house of Ashby is a good old
family mansion, occupied by the widow of the late John Ashby, Esq. A
small room in the detached offices belonging to the house is still shown as
having been the council-chamber, where the gunpowder-plot conspirators


<span class="sidenote">The gunpowder

held their deliberations. Robert Catesby, one of the descendants of the
family, was at the head of this conspiracy, for which he was tried, condemned,
and executed; and his head, together with that of his father-in-law,
Thomas Percie, who was involved in his guilt, were fixed on the top of
the Parliament-house.</p>

<p>[A] ASHCOMBE is a parish in the hundred of Exminster. Here is a
mansion of Lord Arundel's, situated in a large amphitheatre of hills, richly
wooded at their base, and at their summit often studded with herds of
sheep or deer. The only entrance to this romantic dale is from the north,
by a road, which though perfectly safe, falls precipitately down a narrow
ridge of one of the hills.</p>


<p>[B] ASHENDEN. This manor has been from time immemorial in the
Grenville family. John Bucktot, a priest, gave the manor of Little Pollicott,
to Lincoln College, in Oxford, about 1479; and what renders it
particularly remarkable, is the circumstance of the manor house being used


<span class="sidenote">A retiring
place for
collegians in
the time of
the plague.</span>


as a retiring place for the members of the college at the time of the plague.
In Ashenden Church, is an ancient figure of a crusader, under an arch,
rudely ornamented with foliage; which according to tradition, is the tomb
of John Bucktot; this appears however to be erroneous, as it is evidently
the tomb of a layman, and from the chevron on the shield, one of
the Stafford family, anciently lords of Great Pollicott.</p>


<p>[C] ASHFIELD. This obscure village gave birth to the celebrated Lord
Chancellor Thurlow, and his brother, the late Bishop of Durham; they


<span class="sidenote">The birth-place
of Lord Chancellor
Thurlow.</span>


were the sons of the vicar, under whose auspices they were educated. On
leaving the university, the former entered himself of the Inner Temple,
but did not distinguish himself at the bar, until his abilities were employed
upon the Douglas case; after which he became successively Solicitor-General,
Attorney-General, and Lord High Chancellor. He was elevated
to the peerage by the title of Baron Thurlow, of Ashfield. In 1786, he
was made Teller of the Exchequer, and created Baron Thurlow, of Thurlow:
he retired in 1793, and died at Brighton in 1806. He was succeeded
in the peerage by his nephew, the son of his brother, the Bishop of Durham.
He was never married, but he left three illegitimate daughters, to
two of whom he bequeathed large property; the other having offended him
by an imprudent marriage, he left her only a small annuity.</p>


<p>[D] ASHFORD. This village is frequently called Ashford in the water,
from the lowness of its situation. It is seated on the banks of the river
Wye. The only remains of the residence of the Plantagenets of Woodstock
(who had a castle here) is a moat, half filled with rubbish. Sir
William Cavendish, the favourite of Cardinal Wolsey, purchased this
estate of the Earl of Westmoreland; and the Duke of Devonshire, a descendant
of that family, still continues the proprietor. The works in this


<span class="sidenote">Extensive
works for

village for sawing and polishing marble, were the first ever established in
England. They were originally constructed by Mr. Henry Watson, of
Bakewell, about 80 years since, but though he obtained a patent, to secure
the gain arising from this invention, the advantages were unequal to his
expectations. Mr. John Platt, architect, of Rotherham, in Yorkshire,
rented the quarries of black and grey marble, the only ones of the kind
now worked in Derbyshire. The sweeping mill, as it is called, from its
circular motion, will level a floor of eighty superficial feet of marble slabs
at one time.</p>

<p>[A] ASHFORD is situated about twelve miles from the sea, on an eminence
rising from the northern bank of the small river Stour, and on the
high road between Hythe and Maidstone. The town, which is a liberty
of itself, originated from the ruins of Great Chart, an ancient market town,


<span class="sidenote">Origin of
the town of
Ashford.</span>


which gave name to the hundred, and was destroyed in the Danish wars.
It was then called Asscheford, and, in some early documents, Estefort
and Enetesford, from the ford over the river Stour; the ancient name of
which was Esshe or Eschet. It is pleasantly situated near the confluence
of the upper branches of the river Stour, over one of which there is a bridge.
The manor received the privilege of a market so early as Edward I.
The town is governed by a mayor, and possesses a court of record for the
recovery of debts, not exceeding twenty marks. The church is a spacious
and handsome fabric, consisting of a nave, aisles, and three chancels, with
a lofty and well-proportioned tower. There are several ancient monuments,
especially one of a Countess of Athol, who died in 1365, whose
effigy exhibits the female costume of that age, in a very remarkable manner.


<span class="sidenote">The college

The ancient college, founded by Sir John Fogge owner of the manor,
in the reign of Edward IV., was dissolved in that of Henry VII.,
and the house given to the vicar for a residence. It still exists, although
latterly much modernised. Here is a Free Grammar School, founded by
Sir Norton Knatchbull, in the reign of Charles I., and various minor charities.
The inhabitants of this town and its vicinity are much engaged in
the rearing and fattening of cattle, for the sale of which its markets and
fairs are much celebrated.</p>

<p>[B] ASHFORD. This place was originally called Exeford, from its ford
over the river Exe; the village is now but of little importance. It lies in
that level part of the county, formerly occupied by Hounslow Heath, the


<span class="sidenote">Hounslow

terror of the western traveller, from the numerous robberies committed on
its highways. Ashford Common was selected for military reviews; it has
however, for some years been inclosed, and the review ground is now near
Hounslow. The chapel is a plain brick building, possessing no claims on
the attention of the antiquary; it was erected in 1796 by voluntary contribution.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>[C] ASHILL.&mdash;<i>Fairs</i>, April 9, and September 10.</p></div>


<p>[D] ASHINGDON. This place is memorable in the early periods of our
history. "Nothing is more surprising," observes Gough, in his Additions
to Camden, "than the errors all antiquaries have hitherto lain under
with respect to the scene of the battle between Edmund Ironside and the


<span class="sidenote">The site of
an engagement
between Edm.
Ironside and

Danes." Though they had the authority of Mr. Camden against them,
they have caried it quite across the county to the northern extremity and
as far from the sea as possible, in defiance of every circumstance that
could fix it there. In a marsh in Woodham Mortimer parish, on the river
Burnham or Crouch, are twenty-four barrows grouped in pairs, and most
of them surrounded by a ditch, supposed to be the burial places of the
Danes, who probably landed at Bradwell, a village near the mouth of the
Blackwater River, fourteen miles distant.</p>

<p>[A] ASHLEY, was formerly distinguished by a fair and market, it is now
remarkable only for a large mansion, which was once the seat of the
Georges. The church, an ancient building, with a square embattled tower,
is principally interesting for its arches; some of which are round, and
others pointed, resting on slender clustered pillars, with massy capitals of
foliage. The font is large, round, and very rude in its workmanship.</p>


<p>[B] ASHOVER. This village is of great antiquity, being mentioned in the
Doomsday Book, as having a church and a priest. In the church is an
ancient font, supposed to be Saxon; the base is of stone; the lower part
is of an hexagonal form; the upper part circular, surrounded with twenty
figures, in devotional attitudes, embossed in lead, in ornamental niches.
There are also some ancient monuments of the Babington family, who
were for a long time seated at Dithicke, a chapelry in this parish.
Anthony Babington was executed for high treason in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, having engaged in a conspiracy to destroy that princess.


<span class="sidenote">A singular

stone, formerly

On the declivity of a hill on Ashover Common is a rocking stone, called
Robin Hood's Mark, which measures about twenty-six feet in circumference.
From its extraordinary position, it appears not only to have been
the work of art, but to have been placed with great ingenuity. About
200 yards to the north is a singularly shaped work, called the Turning-stone,
nine feet high: it is supposed to have been a rock idol. Overton
Hall, in this vicinity, was once the seat of Sir Joseph Banks, the President
of the Royal Society.</p>


<p>[C] ASHRIDGE was formerly called Escrug. In very early times this
village is reported to have possessed a royal palace; which, when the
estate became the property of Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, son to Richard,
King of the Romans, was converted into a college for Bonhommes (or
monks who followed the rules of St. Augustine,) and endowed with the
manors of Ashridge, Gaddesden, and Hemel Hempstead. A parliament
was held here by Edward the First, in the year 1291; and, though of
short continuance, it was distinguished by a spirited debate on the origin
and necessary use of fines. After the dissolution, the monastery appears


<span class="sidenote">A parliament
held here
by Edward I.</span>


to have become the seat of royalty; and Norden describes it as the place
"wherein our most worthy and ever famous Queen Elizabeth lodged, as
in her owne, being a more statelie house." This queen, in the 17th
year of her reign, granted it to John Dudley, and John Ayscough, who


<span class="sidenote">The manor
house a favourite
seat of Queen
Elizabeth.</span>


within the short period of a fortnight, conveyed it to Henry, Lord Cheny,
whose lady sold it to Ralph Marshal, by whom it was again conveyed to
Randolph Crew and others, and soon afterwards granted to Egerton, Lord
Ellesmere, ancestor to the late Duke of Bridgewater; several of whose
family are buried in the neighbouring church of Little Gaddesden. The
old college, the greater part of which was standing in the year 1800, exhibited
a fine specimen of the gothic architecture of the thirteenth century.
The cloisters were particularly beautiful. The walls were painted in fresco
with Scripture subjects. The late Duke of Bridgewater pulled down the
whole of these buildings, the materials of which were disposed of in lots;
the present earl, the dukedom being extinct, has erected a most magnificent
mansion at a great expense. Ashridge Park, which contains some
very fine oak and beech trees, is pleasingly varied with hill and dale. It
is about five miles in circumference.</p>

Lord Gerrard Digby, of Bromley. The mansion is a large building, with
some square embattled towers, an ancient hall, and other features of a magnificent
baronial castle. It is situated in a fine park, through which flows a
small rivulet, forming a narrow bay, at the western side of the grounds.
The park abounds with wood, and is agreeably diversified with hill and
dale, and affords, from many parts, extensive views across the river Lune
to Morecambe Bay, the Irish sea, &amp;c. The mansion has undergone considerable
alteration, yet care has been taken to preserve its ancient
character.</p>

<p>[B] ASHTON, or LONG ASHTON, is situated in a rich woody vale,
protected on the north by a range of picturesque though bleak hills, and
on the north lies the lofty ridge of Dundry. In this parish the inhabitants
raise fruit and vegetables for the Bristol market. There is much garden-ground
in Long Ashton, in which many Roman coins have been discovered.
The houses are in general well-built, much company resorting
thither during the summer season. The circumjacent scenery is delightful,
and in the vicinity are the remains of two Roman encampments, Stokeleigh
and Burwalls. The church is an old but very handsome building,
founded by the family of Lyons; the nave and aisles are divided from the
chancel by a beautiful gothic screen of fret and flower work, painted and
gilt, and executed in the most admirable style. One of the 6 bells contained
in the tower is inscribed "Sancte Johannes Baptiste ora pro nobis;" on
the tower are the arms of Lyons, in stone. Amongst several painted figures
and coats of arms on the glass of the windows, are the portraits of
Edward IV. and his Queen, Elizabeth Widville. Here are several handsome
monuments, but that of Sir Richard Choke and his lady is eminently
magnificent and beautiful. Ashton Court, the manor house, originally
founded by the Lyons family, but materially altered by Inigo Jones,
occupies the S.E. slope of Ashton Down, and the remains of another old
manor house, called the Lower Court, still stands in a valley to the S.W.
of the village.</p>

<p>[A] ASHTON-UNDER-LYNE is a large town situated at the south-eastern
extremity of the county. It consists of several narrow streets,
built on a high bank, which rises from the river Tame. It appears from
an ancient manuscript, that Ashton was formerly a borough, yet for
some centuries it sent no members to Parliament; but, by the Reform Bill
of 1832, it now returns one member, and the mayor of the town is the
returning officer. The borough comprises the whole district, over which
the lighting and paving act of the 7th and 8th of Geo. IV. extends. A


<span class="sidenote">Court of Requests
for the recovery
of &pound;5. Defendants
may be followed.</span>


court is held here for the recovery of debts, not exceeding five pounds, by
48th Geo. III. c. 18; any person may sue, under the general regulations,
and defendants sued elsewhere are to have their costs. Defendants removing
out of the jurisdiction, may be followed in person and goods, by removing
the record to the superior courts, but wagers, &amp;c. are not recoverable.
The principal part of the landed property of this parish belongs to the Earl
of Stamford, in whose family it was conveyed, by the marriage of Sir
William Booth to the daughter of Sir Thomas Asheton, whose family possessed


<span class="sidenote">The lord of
the manor
possessed a
power of

some peculiar privileges in this manor: among which was, the
power of life and death over their tenantry. In commemoration of this
privilege, and its having been sometimes exercised, a field near the old
hall is still called Gallows Meadow. There is also an ancient custom


<span class="sidenote">Custom of
riding the
black lad.</span>


here, called "riding the black lad," celebrated every Easter Monday, to
perpetuate some act of great tyranny exercised by Sir Ralph Asheton, in
1483, when vice-constable of England. The ceremony consists in exhibiting
the effigies of a man on horseback through the streets, which is
afterwards suspended on the cross in the market place, and there shot.
The figure was formerly cased in armour, and the expenses of it were
defrayed by the court. Another account of the origin of this custom
states, that Thomas Asheton, in the reign of Henry III., particularly distinguished
himself at the battle of Neville's Cross, and bore away the
standard from the Scotch King's tent. For this heroic deed the King
conferred on Ashton the honour of Knighthood, who, on his arrival at
his manor instituted the custom described. At the village of Fairfield, in

this parish, there is a Moravian settlement, who have erected a chapel for
their followers. The males are principally employed in spinning and
weaving: they form a very industrious and orderly community. On the
western side of the town is Ashton Moss, which supplies the poor with
peat turf. Oak and fir trees are frequently found by those who dig for
the peat.</p>

<p>[B] ASHTON. This village is generally called Ashton in Makerfield, or
Ashton in the Willows; it enjoys a very pleasant situation on the road
between Newton and Wigan. The hardware and cotton manufactories
give employment to the inhabitants. The church is a large old building,
part of which appears to have been erected by the lords of the manor. On
the pews are some ancient carvings; and in the windows are exhibited
some painted figures. Several of the Ashtons lie interred here, and their
names are inscribed on the windows. Near the church is a curious mansion,
called the Old Hall, the oldest parts of which are said to have been built
in 1483; adjoining this stands a pile, which was formerly used as a prison.</p>

<p>[A] ASHTON, or STEEPLE ASHTON is remarkable for its lofty and
elegant church, which was built about the year 1480, though the chapels
and a part of the chancel appear of a still earlier date. The tower which
is high and handsome, was formerly surmounted by a spire or steeple,
whence the village had its distinctive appellation. An inscription informs
us that, in the year 1670, the spire being in height 93 feet above the tower,
was rent by a violent thunder storm, and that in the same year, being


<span class="sidenote">The church
steeple
twice
thrown
down by
storms.</span>


almost re-erected, it was by a second storm again destroyed. The roof of
the nave is formed by intersecting arches, which rest on canopied niches,
adorned with whole length figures or flowers; and that of the aisles is
profusely decorated with sculpture and tracery work, while the windows
display some splendid remains of painted glass, the whole corresponding
with the exterior in style and effect. Plot informs us that there was dug
up at Steeple Ashton, a pavement, which he considered to be Roman,
though different in materials and design from those commonly regarded as
such. The Madrepore stone is found among the fossil productions of
Ashton. Rowd Ashton, the seat of Richard Godolphin Long, Esq., is
situated in a large and well wooded park. The Kennet and Avon canal
from London to Bristol passes near this village.</p>


<p>[B] ASHWELL. This village, situate on the river Rhee, on the borders
of Cambridgeshire, derives its present name from Escewelle, and is supposed
by Camden to be of Roman origin, from the frequent discovery of
Roman coins, and sepulchral urns, in an adjacent earthwork, or fortification,
called Arbury banks. It is in a low situation on the northern
edge of the county. Here a considerable spring breaks out from


<span class="sidenote">Powerful
spring
oozing from
a rock.</span>


a rocky bank overhung with lofty ash-trees, from which a continued
quantity of water flows, and being quickly collected into one channel, turns
a mill, and soon after becomes a river. From this spring and these ash-trees,
it is supposed the Saxons gave it the name of Ashwell. The village
was anciently a demesne of the Saxon kings; but before the time of
Edward the Confessor, it was granted to the Abbots of St. Peter's, at
Westminster, to whom it continued to belong till the dissolution, when
the Abbey was erected into a deanery, and after that into a bishopric; it,
however, followed the fate of similar foundations; and when the bishopric
was dissolved, in the reign of Edward VI., it was granted, with other
manors, to the see of London, in which it is still invested. The church
consists of a nave, aisle, and chancel, with a tower at the west-end, surmounted
by a spire. In the chancel are several slabs, formerly inlaid with
brasses. Among the inscriptions, Weever notices one with the words,
"Orate pro&mdash;Walter Sommoner." "I reade," says Weever, "that one
Walter Sumner held the manor of Ashwell of the King, by pettie sergeantie;
viz. to find the king spits to rost his meate upon the day of his
coronation: and John Sumner, his sonne, held the same manor by
service, to turne a spit in the king's kitchen upon the day of his coronation."</p>

<p>[A] ASKERNE. This village is one of the numerous places in the West
Riding, which enjoys the distinction of a mineral spring. The water resembles
that of Harrowgate Spa; but taken internally, differs materially in
its operation, acting chiefly as a diuretic without any of that cathartic
or purgative power, for which the Harrowgate waters are so remarkable.
The village is situated at the foot of a hill; the spring rises at the distance
of a few yards only from a piece of water called Askerne Pool, seven acres
in extent, and is much frequented by rheumatic or scorbutic patients, who
seldom fail to obtain the relief which they seek. Near this place it is

<p>[B] ASKERTON. At this village there is a castle which was built by
the Barons Dacre. This well known name is derived from the exploits of
one of their ancestors at the siege of Acre, or Ptolemais, under Richard
C&oelig;]ur de Lion. There were two powerful branches of that name. The
first family, called Lord Dacres of the South, held the castle of the same
name, and are ancestors to the present Lord Dacre. The other family, descended


<span class="sidenote">Seat of Lord
Dacre.</span>


from the same stock, were called Lord Dacres of the North, and
were Barons of Gillesland and Graystock. A chieftain of the latter branch
was warden of the West Marshes, during the reign of Edward VI. He
was a man of a hot and obstinate character, as appears from some particulars
of Lord Surrey's letter to Henry VIII., giving an account of his
behaviour at the siege and storm of Jedburgh. The castle was formerly
garrisoned by the Serjeant of Gillesland, who sometimes commanded and
led the inhabitants against the Scots.</p>


<p>[C] ASKHAM. This place consists of two manors. The hall, built in
1574, on the river Lowther, has an embattled roof, and a sombre aspect
well suited to the gloom of the surrounding scenery. Several remarkable


<span class="sidenote">Druid's

heaps of stones, among which, one is called the Druid's Cross, are in this
neighbourhood; and also a large cairn, called the White-raise.</p>

<p>[D] ASKRIGG. This ancient market town is situated near the river Ure
and Swaledale Forest: it resembles a large village, and the occupations of
the inhabitants are principally the knitting of stockings and making butter
or cheese. It is remarkable, chiefly, for some considerable cataracts in its
neighbourhood: as Millgill Force, a fall of from twenty to thirty yards;
Whitfields Force, a grand specimen of the picturesque; and Hardrow

<span class="sidenote">Cataract

<p>[A] ASLACKBY. In this village, which is on the direct road from
London to Lincoln, there was a commandery, or associated body of Knights
Templars, founded in the time of Richard I., by John le Mareshall. It
afterwards served for the hospitallers, and at the suppression of this society,
the property was transferred to Edward, Lord Clinton. A farm-house,
which now occupies the site of the old circular church, is called the
temple. Of that ancient structure there yet remains a square embattled


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
village.</span>


tower of two stories. The lower story is vaulted, and formed of eight
groins, in the centre of which is displayed eight shields, and various coats
of arms. The parish church is a handsome building, with an embattled
tower at the west end. A castle formerly stood here, but no vestiges of
the walls can now be seen: remnants, however, of the foss and earthworks
point out the spot where it was situated.</p>

<p>[B] ASPATRIA, or ASPATRIC, is a long straggling village on the side
of a hill, about five miles distant from the Irish sea. It now forms part
of the estate of the Earl of Egremont, but is supposed to have derived its
name from Gospatrick, Earl of Dunbar. On removing the earth of a
barrow, which stood at Beacon-hill, an eminence about 200 yards to the
north of the village, in the year 1790, a human skeleton was found in a


<span class="sidenote">Prodigious
skeleton, 7ft. from the
head to the
ancle-bone.</span>


kind of chest, or kistvaen, formed by two large cobblestones at each end,
and the same on each side. The feet were decayed and rotted off, but
from the head to the ancle-bone, the skeleton measured seven feet. On
exposure to the atmospheric air the other bones soon mouldered away.
Near the shoulder, on the left side, was a broad sword five feet long, the
guard of which was elegantly inlaid with silver flowers: a dirk, or dagger,
lay on the right side; it was one foot and a half long, and the handle
seemed to have been studded with silver. There were likewise found part
of a golden fibula, or buckle, a broken battle-axe, an ornament for the end
of a belt, a part of which yet remained, part of a spur, and a bit resembling


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
relics found.</span>


modern snaffle. Various figures, rudely sculptured, remained on
the stones which enclosed the left side of the chest; they chiefly represented
circles, each having within a cross in relief. Hayman Rooke, Esq., the
learned antiquary, from whose account the above particulars are taken,
supposed that the personage whose remains were found was buried soon
after the first dawning of Christianity; and also, inferred from the rich
ornaments found in the tomb, that he was a chieftain of high rank.</p>



<p>[C] ASSENDON. At this township is a land spring, reputed the most
eminent of its kind in England. The water only appears after a continuance
of wet weather, but then issues forth in such abundance, that
mills might be turned by the current, and the adjacent lowlands are inundated.
This spring has been supposed by some to act on the principle


<span class="sidenote">Wonderful
spring.</span>


of a natural syphon, and to be supplied from subterranean sources; but
this is evidently erroneous, as the seasons of its flowing are uniformly after
heavy rains.</p>

<p>[A] ASTBURY, or AUSTBURY, is an extensive village and contains
several gentlemen's seats. The church is a handsome gothic structure,
with a lofty steeple. In the church yard are two ancient monuments,
ornamented with the insignia of knighthood, but the names of the families
whose memories they were intended to record are now lost. The parish
of Astbury contains no less than twelve townships, of which the market


<span class="sidenote">Contains 12
townships.</span>


town of Congleton is one. Each of these townships has its overseer and
other officers, but the whole parish is under the government of one church-warden,
the office of which is served in rotation by eight persons, vulgarly
denominated the "Posts of the Parish;" though they should properly
be called Provosts.</p>



<p>[B] ASTHALL. At this village is an old manorial mansion, now used
as a farm-house, which was formerly the residence of Sir Richard Jones,
one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas in the reign of Charles
the First. In the north aisle of the church stands a large stone coffin,


<span class="sidenote">Alice
Corbett.</span>


said to contain the remains of Alice Corbett, concubine to Henry I.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Mail</i> arrives 5 morning; departs 9.35 evening.</p></div>



<p>[C] ASTLEY. This manor was held, in the reign of Henry II., by Philip
de Estley, of the Earl of Warwick, by the service of holding the Earl's


<span class="sidenote">Singular
tenure.</span>


stirrup when he mounted or alighted from his horse. From this person
are descended two families, seated at Hill Morton, in this county, and at
Patshull, in Staffordshire. In the reign of Henry V. the estate passed
by marriage to the Greys of Ruthin, from whom it descended to Henry
Grey, Marquis of Dorset, and Duke of Suffolk, beheaded in the reign of
Queen Mary, for an attempt to make Lady Jane Grey queen. The manor
belongs at present to F.P. Newdigate, Esq. Astley Castle is surrounded
by a moat, along the inner edge of which lie the remains of massive walls.
The habitable part of the mansion is probably not older than the time of
Mary; but it is clad in a garb of ivy, and other evergreens, which renders
it singularly picturesque. In one room is preserved a portrait of the
factious Suffolk, respecting whose capture the following particulars are
related:&mdash;"Finding that he was forsaken, he put himself under the trust


<span class="sidenote">Lord Suffolk
betrayed by
his keeper.</span>


of one Underwood, as it is said, a keeper of his park here at Astley, who
hid him for some few days in a large hollow tree, standing about two
bow-shots from the church; but, being promised a reward, he betrayed
him." The church of Astley having been made collegiate, by Lord
Thomas de Astley, was by him rebuilt, and adorned with a spire, so lofty
that it served as a land-mark in the deep wood-lands of the district, and
was popularly termed "The lanthorn of Arden."&mdash;The interior is curious
and interesting, although many monuments and decorations have been
removed or destroyed at various times. On an altar-tomb at the west-end
are the effigies, in alabaster, of a warrior and a lady; and on another, is the
mutilated figure of a female in a recumbent posture: both are without
inscription.</p>


<p>[D] ASTLEY. This village is situated on the Severn, it was noted before
the dissolution, for its priory of Benedictines, and is now remarkable chiefly
for a hermitage formed in the living rock, and recently converted into an


<span class="sidenote">Hermitage.</span>


ale-house. The church, built in the Saxon style of architecture, contains
some monuments and a few fragments of stained glass. Here is the ancient
seat called Glasshampton.</p>

<p>[A] ASTON. The village and manor of Aston was an ancient demesne
of the Saxon kings. Henry VIII. granted the manor to Sir John Boteler,
of Walton Wood Hall; but the house now standing at Aston Place, indicates
earlier antiquity than the time of that sovereign. Westward of the village,


<span class="sidenote">The six
hills.</span>


on the eastern side of the great North road, are six large barrows, thought
to be of Danish origin; from their immediate proximity to the road-side
they excite the curiosity and attention of most persons travelling northward:
two of them have been opened, but were not found to contain any
thing of sufficient interest to be here recorded.</p>


<p>[B] ASTON is in the Birmingham division of the Hundred of Hemlingford.
It may be deemed a part of Birmingham, being inhabited chiefly by


<span class="sidenote">Part of
Birmingham.</span>


artisans in the various branches of manufacture for which that
town is distinguished. Aston Hall, the seat of Heneage Legge, Esq.,
was first erected by Sir Thomas Holt, Bart. in the reign of James I. It
was several times plundered during the troubles of his successor, who was
entertained here for two nights a short time before the battle of Edgehill,
which occurred on October 23, 1642, between the Royalists and the
Parliamentary forces. Sir T. Holt endowed an alms-house for five poor
men and women in this parish.</p>


<p>[C] ASTON, is a parish and township with Aughton, in the wapentake
of Strafforth and Tickhill. In the church, which is dedicated to All Saints,
is an ancient monument, under which lie buried Lord D'Arcy and his
three wives. There is also a marble slab to the memory of the poet


<span class="sidenote">The poet
Mason's
monument.</span>


Mason, who was rector of this parish. This distinguished poet was the
son of a clergyman in Yorkshire, in which county he was born in the
year 1725. He became a student of St. John's College, Cambridge, and
subsequently a fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the same university. His
debut in the literary world was made by the publication of "Isis," a poem,
in which he satirized the Jacobitish and High Church principles of the
University of Oxford. A reply was written by Thomas Warton, entitled
"The Triumph of Isis." In 1752 he published a tragedy with choral
odes on the ancient Greek model, called "Elfrida." Having taken orders
in the church, he was presented with the living of Aston, and appointed
one of the royal chaplains. In 1759 appeared his "Caractacus," a drama
on a kindred plan with the former. Both of these pieces were afterwards
introduced on the stage, they however met with very little success. In
1762, Mr. Mason was made precentor of York, to which preferment a
canonry was annexed. One of his principal works, entitled "The English
Garden," a poem, in four books, appeared in the years 1772, 1777,
1779, and 1781. 4to.; this was translated into French and German. In
1775 he published the exquisite poems of his friend Gray, with a Memoir
of his Life. At the beginning of the American War, Mr. Mason became


<span class="sidenote">An advocate

so active an advocate for freedom, as to give offence at court, and he was
in consequence dismissed from his chaplainship. It is said he felt alarmed
at the frightful consequences of the French Revolution, and his zeal
cooled towards the latter end of his life. He died April 7, 1797.</p>

<p>[A] ASTON CLINTON is in the first division of Aylesbury hundred. The
manor was the property of the late Lord Lake, who died in 1808, during
the trial of General Whitelock, who was cashiered for his misconduct at
Buenos Ayres at the commencement of that year. At St. Leonard's, a
hamlet of this parish, about four miles from Aston church, is an ancient
chapel, said to have been a chantry chapel to the Abbey of Missenden. It


<span class="sidenote">Monument
of one of
Queen
Anne's
officers.</span>


contains, among other monuments, that of General Cornelius Wood, an
officer who distinguished himself in the reign of Queen Anne, and who
died in 1712. It is ornamented with a bust of the general in white
marble, surrounded with military trophies. This chapel is endowed
with an estate, vested in ten trustees, who have the appointment of the
minister.</p>



<p>[B] STEEPLE ASTON. At this village, Dr. Samuel Radcliffe, principal
of Brazennose College, Oxford, and rector of this church, founded a free

<span class="sidenote">Dr. Samuel
Radcliffe.</span>

school in 1640, and endowed it with ten pounds per annum; he died in
the year 1648, and is buried in the church. He also endowed an alms-house
for poor women in this parish. A tessalated pavement was ploughed
up here in the 17th century.</p>


<p>[C] ASTROPE. This hamlet is in the parish of King's Sutton. The
village is worthy of remark, from the church having a tower crowned
with a handsome and lofty spire, decorated with crocketed pinnacles.
Here is a remarkably fine mineral spring, called St. Rumbald's Well, which


<span class="sidenote">A mineral
spring famous
for curing
consumption,
jaundice, &amp;c.</span>


was formerly in considerable repute. When drank at the fountain head,
the water is considered a specific in cases of female obstructions, and in
the first and second stages of consumptions. In the jaundice it seldom
fails; and in dropsical cases is frequently administered with success. Persons
whose constitutions have been weakened by free living, find themselves
renovated by its virtues. The water has a brisk pleasant taste, and
is very clear and spirituous. Astrope Hall was formerly the residence of
the Lord Chief Justice Willes.</p>


<p>[D] ASTWELL. In this hamlet is an ancient mansion, formerly the
seat of the Earl of Ferrers. Several of the rooms exhibit in the wainscot

<span class="sidenote">Seat of Earl
Ferrers</span>

and chimney pieces, armorial bearings and other carved decorations. A
dilapidated room at the east end was formerly a chapel.</p>

<p>[A] ST. ATHAN. In this village is a castle, called East Orchard, built in
the year 1691, by Roger Berkrols; it stands on the edge of an extensive
flat: a luxuriant wild fig tree grows out of the cement of the chapel walls.
Perhaps the Turkey fig tree might be propagated with more success,
grafted upon this wildling, which probably originated in the cultivated fig
planted in the gardens of the Norman lords. In St. Athan's church there


<span class="sidenote">The largest
inhabited
castle in
Wales.</span>


are two uncommonly fine gothic monuments of the Berkrol's family: there
are likewise in this parish the remains of two castles&mdash;West Orchard and
Castleton; but these are not of such great antiquity. From this spot there
is a good view of Fonmore, or Fronmon Castle, which is the most extensive
and august of the Welch inhabited castles. The kitchen is said to be
the largest in the kingdom. In Fronmon castle is an excellent portrait of
Oliver Cromwell. The flat and steep-holms are seen from this neighbourhood:
the former has its light-house. It is situated nearly ten miles from
the sea lock of the canal, and three miles from the adjacent steep-holms,
which is a smaller island than the former, though more conspicuous from
its great height above the water; it is quite barren and uninhabited. The
flat holms at low tide is an extensive sheet of mud, excepting one deep


<span class="sidenote">Account of

channel. The landing place is near the castle rock, a dangerous, but
romantic beach, so called from its similarity to a castle, it is very large, and
is said to resemble Abergavenny castle. In the centre is a bold arch, which
at high water is covered. The hollow sound of the sea roaring through
the arch, and the waves occasionally retreating, and then forcing their
way back with redoubled fury, has an uncommonly fine effect. At low tide
the shore all around the base is dry. The island is four or five miles in
circumference; the soil is good, and would, if well cultivated, be very
productive. From the light-house, which is 80 feet in height, is a delightful
prospect of the Bristol Channel and the shores of Somerset and
Glamorgan. It is the resort of many visitors in the summer season.</p>


<p>[B] ATHERSTONE. This market town is supposed to have derived its
name from "a stone" under which an "adder" of enormous size was
found; it is situated on the Watling Street, and divided from Leicestershire
by the river Anker, and was a place of some importance at the Conquest:
at which time the town was given to the monks of Bee in Normandy,
who obtained for it a market day and an annual fair, which


<span class="sidenote">Some foreign
monks
obtained
this market.</span>


brought it into consequence. A monastery of friars, (Hermits of Saint
Augustine,) was founded at Atherstone in the year 1375. The church
belonging to the friary was completed in the reign of Richard II. A free
grammar school was founded here by Sir William Devereux and two other
benevolent persons in the year 1573. The chancel of the friary church
was appropriated to the use of this seminary, and is still dedicated to the
same purpose. The mansion, or hall house was sometime after separated
from the chapel, and rebuilt at a short distance upon a pleasant bank,
commanding an extensive view over the adjacent counties of Leicester,
Derby, and Stafford. Two nights before the battle of Bosworth Field
(which is but nine miles distant), the Duke of Richmond lay at Atherstone,
where he had his interview with the two Stanley's, in which such
measures of co-operation were concerted as occasioned the overthrow of
King Richard III., and it is said, that many persons from the subsequent
battle were buried below this old mansion, from which the spot has retained
the name of the bloody bank. It appears, however, to have been
so called from being the place where contests of less serious results were
usually decided by the young champions of the ancient foundation school,
which is still supported by a respectable endowment. Atherstone Hall has


<span class="sidenote">Atherstone
Hall.</span>


recently been much improved by extended buildings and ornamental plantations.
It is situated near Merevale Hall, the seat of D.S. Dugdale, Esq.,
and Grendon Hall, that of Sir G. Chetwynd, Bart. Here are manufactories
of hats, ribbons, and shalloons, and considerable business is done at the
four annual fairs; that in September being the most considerable in England
for the sale of cheese. The passage of the Coventry canal, uniting
with that of the Trent and Mersey, within a hundred yards of the town,
adds very considerably to its facilities of trading. The poet Drayton,
author of the "Polyolbion," was a native of Atherstone.</p>

<p>[A] ATTENBOROUGH. This village, supposed to be the ancient Attenton,
lies nearly on the banks of the river Trent. Its church is large, and also
well filled: it serves for Chilwell, Toueton, and part of Bramcote. This
place is remarkable, for having given birth to Henry Ireton, the regicide,


<span class="sidenote">Birth-place
of the regicide,
son-in-law
of Oliver
Cromwell.</span>

son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell. He was the eldest son of Gervase Ireton,
Esq., and brother to Sir John Ireton, Lord Mayor of London in 1658.
He was a gentleman commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1629, and
at the age of 19 he took one degree in Arts. Wood tells us, that he had
the character in that college of a stubborn and saucy fellow towards the
seniors. Afterwards he went to the Middle Temple, where he became
grounded in the common law. When the rebellion broke out he took
up arms against the king, was a recruiter in the long parliament, and
about that time married Bridget, one of the daughters of Cromwell, then
only colonel of a regiment. He became first a captain, afterwards
colonel, and at length commissary-general, in 1645. He is said to have
been the best prayer-maker and preacher in the whole army. He drew
up the famous remonstrance requiring justice to be done on their
sovereign. He sat as judge on the king's trial, and was one of the committee
that appointed the time and place of execution. In Cromwell's
expedition to Ireland, he was appointed second in command, with the
rank of major-general, and was afterwards made president of Munster;
being left as deputy by Cromwell, in 1649, he died the next year of a sudden
disorder at Limerick. On his death, the parliament settled a pension
of &pound;2000. per annum on his widow and children, out of the estates of the
Duke of Buckingham.</p>


<p>[B] ATTLEBOROUGH, or ATTLEBURGH. This small market town
was formerly a place of considerable consequence. During the Saxon era
it was a post of strength and served as a check to the Danes in their predatory
incursions. Its fortifications are said to have been conspicuous in
the time of Henry II. Attleborough formerly belonged to the Mortimers;
from them it passed to the Ratcliffe family, of whom it was purchased by
Sir Francis Blickley, Bart., whence it came into possession of the family
of Ash. A college, dedicated to the Holy Cross, was founded here in the
reign of Richard II., by Sir Robert de Mortimer, for a custos and four
fellows. The church, with the east end is entire; it is in the collegiate
form, and consists of a large nave with aisles and a north and south
transept; it contains the monuments of many persons of distinction. On
a flat stone in the nave is an inscription to the memory of Captain John
Gibbs, a celebrated horse racer and gamester, in the reign of Charles I.

This person having laid a wager that he would drive his carriage and
four horses up and down the steepest place of the Devil's Ditch, on Newmarket
Heath, succeeded in winning the bet, by making a very light
chaise, with a jointed perch, and without any pole. It is worthy of
remark, that the first turnpike road in the kingdom, was made at Attleborough,
by an Act passed for that purpose in 1707.</p>

<p>[A] ST. ANDREWS, AUCKLAND. This place is celebrated for the
church having been made collegiate by Bishop Beck, although it is probable
there was some foundation here before the time of that prelate.
The edifice is situated on a rising ground, in a valley near the banks of the
river Gaunless, and has the form of a cross with a tower at the west end.
In the inside is a curious wooden figure, said to be an effigy of one of


<span class="sidenote">Curious

the family of Polland, which represents a knight sitting cross-legged and
dressed in a coat of mail, with his hands raised and his feet resting on a
lion.</p>


<p>[B] AUDLEY END is principally celebrated for its vicinity to Audley
House, which was sold by the third Earl of Suffolk, to Charles II., for
&pound;50,000., the king, however, left a great part of the sum on mortgage.
The present mansion, though a large and magnificent structure, consists
only of a small part of the original building, owing to its curtailment
at various times. When in its perfect state, it was esteemed one
of the most splendid and capacious mansions in the country; and, if not
superior, was nearly equal to the palaces of Hampton Court, Nonsuch,
and Richmond. At the time when it was first built, large, rather than
comfortable or handsome houses were fashionable. Influenced by these sentiments,
Thomas Howard, the first Earl of Suffolk, (as Walpole observes,)
determined to have "an immense pile of building," and &pound;190,000. was
expended upon its erection. It is said that, when the house was finished,
King James was invited to see it. Having surveyed the structure with


<span class="sidenote">Anecdote of
James I.</span>


great astonishment, the earl asked him "how he liked it?" "Very well,"
replied James, "but troth man," continued he sarcastically, "it is too
much for a king, but it may do for a Lord High Treasurer." An elegant
domestic chapel, constructed by the late Lord Howard, occupies the north
west corner of the house. It is fitted up with clustered columns, pointed
arches, and fan like tracery; and, in imitation of a cathedral, it has a
nave, side-aisles and transepts. The windows are filled with painted
glass, by Pickett of York, who executed them in 1771, from Biaggio
Rebecca's designs.</p>

<p>[A] AUGHTON. This village is chiefly distinguished for having been
the seat of an ancient and respectable family long since extinct, or dispersed.


<span class="sidenote">Once the
seat of Sir
Robert
Aske.</span>


The Askes, who succeeded the family of Hai, resided here from
about the year 1365, till the reign of Charles I., when the head of the
family was one of the judges of that unfortunate monarch. Of this family,
also, was Sir Robert Aske, a man of daring and enthusiastic courage,
possessing considerable talents, who headed the insurrection called "the
Pilgrimage of Grace," in the days of Henry VIII. Of the family seat,
nothing remains but the site, marked by several moats.</p>



<p>[B] AUKBOROUGH. Dr. Stukely having discovered a Roman castrum
and a vicinal road here, supposed it to be the Aquis of Ravennas. The
Roman station is square, each side 300 feet; the entrance is at the north,
and the west side faces the steep cliff that over-hangs the Trent. The
situation of this castle at the north-west angle of Lincolnshire, renders it
a kind of watch tower over Nottingham and Yorkshire, which it surveys.
The camp is now called "Countess Close," and tradition speaks of a
Countess of Warwick having resided here. The vallum and ditch are
nearly entire; a square plat called the "Oreen," is supposed to have
been appropriated for the soldiers when on duty. Within this is a round
walk into a labyrinth, called Julian's Bower; these bowers are usually


<span class="sidenote">Julian's
bower.</span>


found in the neighbourhood of Roman towns, and are objects of great
curiosity to uninformed people. Dr. Stukeley is of opinion that they
were the arena of some of their ancient games, brought into Italy from
Troy, and that they derived their name from "borough," any work consisting
of ramparts of earth, and not from "bower" an arbour. The
views in this neighbourhood are very beautiful; the winding Trent with
its rich level plains of meadow, all alive with herds of cattle; the cliff,
commanding a noble view of the three rivers; the hanging woods and
ornamented walks, all form a great contrast to what Lincolnshire is often
represented by those who have visited only the fenny parts of this fertile
county.</p>


<p>[C] AUST, or AUST CLIVE. Here is a celebrated ferry over the Severn
into South Wales. The Propr&aelig;tor, Ostorius Scapula, was accustomed to
ferry his legions over near this place. In the time of Edward the Elder,


<span class="sidenote">Celebrated

Wales.</span>


who was lying here with his army, Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, was stationed
at Beachley, on the opposite bank. Llewellyn, who was required
to pay homage to the English Sovereign, refused to cross the passage; but
Edward immediately crossing in a boat, was seen, as he approached the
shore by Llewellyn, who, overcome by the condescension, rushed into the
water, and taking the monarch upon his shoulders, carried him to land,
and did him homage for the principality. The Severn is here nearly two
miles across.</p>

<p>[A] ST. AUSTELL is a considerable market town, which belongs to
the north-eastern division of the county, and is one of the polling
places. The petty sessions of the hundred of Powder are held here.
Considerable quantities of corn and other articles are brought to the
market. The town is seated on the eastern side of a hill which slopes
gradually to a rivulet which runs along a narrow valley; this stream, and
the inequality of the ground, have been rendered eminently useful to the
manufactories of the neighbourhood. The water which has been conducted
round the side of the hills, in its course impels the machinery of several
stamping-mills, which have been erected on different levels. It is also
employed to cleanse and separate the tin from the pounded mass. Through
its vicinity to the great tin mine of Polgooth, St. Austell has within the
last sixty or seventy years, considerably increased in the number of its


<span class="sidenote">Blackmore
Court held
here.</span>


houses and inhabitants. The holding of the Blackmore Court here, which
is the most considerable of the stannary courts, or courts relating to the
tin works, have also contributed to augment its prosperity. The old town,
or rather village, was at some little distance to the east, and its site is still
marked by a few cottages; the present town is the regular thoroughfare for
travellers from Plymouth to Falmouth; the streets are very narrow, and not
having any pavement for foot passengers are somewhat unsafe. The only
blowing houses in the county are at the east end of this town; they are three
in number, and very spacious; the old smelting houses are supplied with
coals, and are reverberatory; but in these blowing houses the fire is
of charcoal, and ignited by air impelled through tubes by cylinders
instead of bellows; this mode of fluxing the ore is considered by the workmen
far preferable to the other. The inhabitants of this town, from its
proximity to the sea, are principally employed in the pilchard fishery and
in mining; there is however a small manufactory of serges. The parish
church is a fine old fabric, consisting of three aisles; the tower and some
other parts of the structure are fancifully ornamented; various carvings,
monstrous heads, angels, and other figures appear on the cornices. From
the repetition of the shovel, pick, hammers, and other tools, it seems
probable that the miners were the principle contributors towards the expences
of the building. In the year 1774, as some tinners were searching
for tin in a stream work near the town, about seventeen feet under the
surface of the ground, they discovered a silver cup, which is now used for
wine at the Communion table, in which were several ancient pieces of
gold and silver ornaments; they consisted of bracelets, rings, and buckles,


<span class="sidenote">Silver cup

evidently for a person of high rank, with many of the most curious Saxon
coins ever discovered at one time. All these articles fell out on moving
the ground, and some were probably lost in shovelling out the rubbish;
those which were picked up were dispersed about the country, and many
of them broken. The celebrated Pentuan stone quarry, from which the
materials of many churches and family seats have been taken, is in this
parish. Polgooth mine (before mentioned) was considered the richest ever
worked in England, and is situated about two miles south-west of the
town. The surrounding country appears for many miles bleak, desolate,
and barren, yet its bowels contain vast treasures; though, as a talented
author has observed, "like the shabby mien of a miser, its aspect does
not correspond with its hoards." The shafts by which the miners descend,
and through which the ore is raised to the surface, are scattered over a
considerable extent of sterile ground, whose dreary appearance, and the
sallow countenances of the miners, concur to excite ideas of gloom, apprehension,
and melancholy. The number of shafts is not less than fifty,
from twenty to thirty of which are constantly in use. When a stranger
is induced to descend, he is previously accoutred in a flannel shirt and
trowsers, a close cap, an old hat to shelter his face from droppings, and a
thick pair of shoes. A lighted candle is put into one hand, and a spare
one suspended to a button of his jacket. Every part of the ordinary clothing
is laid aside, and the flannel dress worn close to the skin, in order to
absorb the profuse perspiration which the closeness of the mine or the
labour of mounting the ladders may occasion.</p>

<p>[A] AUSTHORPE. This township gave birth to the celebrated civil
engineer John Smeaton, distinguished as the architect of Eddystone Light-house,
and, as the conductor of various other important undertakings. He


<span class="sidenote">Birth-place

was the son of an attorney, who, observing that he had a strong taste for
mechanics, wisely allowed him to follow the impulse of his genius, and
become a mathematical instrument maker. He commenced business in
that capacity, in Holborn, London, in 1750. His great undertaking&mdash;the
erection of the light-house on the Eddystone rock, was accomplished
in the year 1759, and it was executed in such a manner as almost to bid
defiance to the power of time or accident. His death took place in his
native village, September 8, 1792.&mdash;See Eddystone Light-house.</p>


<p>[B] AVEBURY or ABURY, is situated within the very area of a British
temple, and claims the particular attention of the topographer and antiquary.
The enclosure, which is formed by a wide and deep ditch, and a
lofty external vallum, contains many large stones, some of which are erect,
and the others lying on the ground. Southward of this place, at some
distance, are other large stones, erect or prostrate; and, westward, are
two others, erect. Several walls and houses of the village are constructed


<span class="sidenote">A British
temple
formed of

with broken masses of these ponderous monuments; yet enough remains
to excite curiosity and prompt research. The following is a description
of this great temple, in its original state:&mdash;Immediately within the ditch,
and encompassing the whole area, was a continued series of large upright
stones, consisting of one hundred in number; these stones were placed
at the distance of twenty-seven feet from each other, and usually measured
from fifteen to seventeen feet in height, and about forty feet in circumference.
Within the area of this circle, the diameter of which was
about 1400 feet, were two double circles; the exterior circles were about
466 feet in diameter, and formed by thirty stones of similar dimensions
equally distant from each other, as in the large enclosing circle. Of these
singular stones there are but few remaining; but from the extraordinary
dimension of these relics of antiquity, the traveller may judge for himself
the correctness of our notice.</p>

<p>[A] AVINGTON. Sir Francis Burdett is lord of this manor, and patron


<span class="sidenote">Sir Francis
Burdett.</span>


of the rectory. The church, which remains nearly in its original state,
exhibits a curious specimen of Saxon architecture. Within the walls it
measures 75 feet by 14 feet and a half. The nave is separated from the
chancel by an arch richly ornamented by a zig-zag moulding, and a great
variety of grotesque heads springing from two enriched piers; the arch is
formed of the segments of two circles, each having different centres. In
this church there is also a very singular font, of rude workmanship, surrounded
with grotesque figures, executed in bass-relief; that is to say,
sculpture, the figures of which do not stand out from the ground in their
full proportion.</p>


<p>[B] AVINGTON, anciently Abyngton, is remarkable for its beautiful
park, the seat of Chandos Grenville, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Lieutenant


<span class="sidenote">Seat of the
Duke of
Buckingham.</span>


of the county of Bucks. The manor was originally a royal demesne,
or estate in lands, and was given by king Edgar to the monastery of St.
Swithin at Winchester, in the year 961; it continued in the possession
of that house until the dissolution of monasteries, when it became the
property of the clerks of Mitcheldever, (a village about five miles distant,)
with whom it remained until the reign of Elizabeth; and then passed to the
Bruges, or Brydges family, afterwards raised to the dukedom of Chandos.
Anna Maria Brudenell, the infamous Countess of Shrewsbury, married
one of this family; her former husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, died
from a wound received in a duel with the Duke of Buckingham, during
the fighting of which the Countess had the audacity to hold the horse of
her gallant, disguised as a page. Charles the Second was frequently the


<span class="sidenote">A seat of
one of the
paramours
of Charles
II.</span>


guest of this notorious woman at the mansion of Avington, which thus
became the scene of that licentious monarch's pleasures. The mansion,
which is mostly built of brick, has been greatly improved since it came
into the possession of the present proprietor. It is situated in a well
planted and secluded valley, nearly environed with high downs, which
from their bare and open state, form a singular though not unpleasing
contrast with the scenery immediately contiguous to the house. Several
of the apartments are fitted up with great elegance, and enriched by a
choice collection of valuable paintings.</p>



<p>[C] AXBRIDGE. This town is one of the polling places for the eastern
division of the county of Somerset, but the court for the election of the
Knights of the Shire is at Wells. The borough sent members to parliament
during the reigns of the three first Edwards, but was afterwards
excused on the plea of poverty. It consists chiefly of one street, winding


<span class="sidenote">A borough

from east to west, about half a mile in length. The shambles and market
are towards the east end. Although so small, it is governed by a corporation,
consisting of a mayor, bailiff, and ten aldermen, and twenty-two
burgesses, with a recorder, town-clerk, and other officers. Knit
hose are manufactured in this town. The church, occupying an eminence,
near the market-house, is a large and handsome gothic structure, in the
form of a cross. The cloth of the communion table is elegantly wrought
in silk, by Mrs. Abigail, who employed seven years in completing it.
This lady, and several of her family, have monuments in the church.</p>

<p>[A] AXMINSTER is very irregularly built, and the houses are inelegant,
but the air of the town is reckoned highly salubrious. The petty sessions
of the hundred of Axminster are held here. The lower orders are mostly
employed in manufacturing carpets, leather breeches, gloves, &amp;c. The


<span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>


manner of weaving carpets here is different from that pursued at most
other places; the carpets being woven in the piece, and several hands employed
at the same loom. The common patterns are flowers, roses, &amp;c.,
though the Turkey and Persian carpets have been imitated with success.
In many large pieces Roman tesselated pavements have been copied, which
have produced a very rich effect. The tunnel between Charmouth and
was opened in the month of January, 1832. This improvement
is substantially constructed with an elliptic arch, capable of allowing two
stage waggons of the largest size to pass on it, and is rather more than

and steepest hill between London and Exeter is avoided. A gentleman
who visited the tunnel during the height of the ensuing summer, remarked
the astonishing coolness which he felt within this hill's enclosed
semi-cylinder; no sooner, however, had he left it, than he fainted from
the difference of temperature between this subterraneous passage and that
of the open air.</p>

<p>[B] AYLESBURY. The &AElig;glesbury of the Saxons, is a considerable
market town, situated near the centre of the county, rising gradually on
all sides in a rich and extensive tract, denominating the "Vale of Aylesbury."
Drayton in his Poly-Albion has the following lines descriptive
of this celebrated vale:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
Aylesbury's vale that walloweth in her wealth,<br />
And (by her wholesome air continually in health)<br />
Is lusty, firm, and fat; and holds her youthful strength.<br />
</p>

<p>This was originally a strong British town, which maintained its independence
till the year 571, when it was reduced by the West Saxons. In the
year 600, it became famous as the burial place of St. Osyth, who was


<span class="sidenote">St. Osyth.</span>


born at Quarrendon, two miles distance, and beheaded in Essex by the
Pagans. Her relics were interred in this church, and are said to have
performed many miracles; a religious house was founded in honour of
William the Conqueror, who parcelled it out under the singular tenure:&mdash;that


<span class="sidenote">Singular
tenure of
this manor.</span>


the tenants should find litter or straw for the king's bedchamber
three times a year, if he came that way so often, and provide him with
three eels in winter, and three green geese in summer. In the reign of
Henry VIII., the manor was sold by Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wilts,
father of Queen Anne Boleyn, to Sir John Baldwin, whose daughter took
it in marriage to Robert Pakington, who was murdered in the year 1537,
on account of his zeal for the reformed religion. It continued in this
family till the year 1801, when it was sold by Sir John Pakington, Bart.,
to the Marquis of Buckingham. How completely the manor and the town
itself were in the possession of the Pakington family, will appear from the
following remarkable letter preserved in the Chapel of the Rolls, among
the returns of Parliament writs of the fourteenth of Queen Elizabeth:&mdash;"To
all Christian people, to whom this present writing shall come: I,


<span class="sidenote">Remarkable
Parliamentary
writ.</span>


Dorothy Pakington, late wife of Sir John Pakington, lord and owner of
the town of Aylesbury, send greeting. Know ye me, the said Dorothy
Pakington, to have chosen, named, and appointed my trusty and well-beloved
Thomas Litchfield, and George Burden, Esqrs., to be my burgesses
of my said town of Aylesbury; and whatever the said Thomas
and George, burgesses, shall do in the service of the Queen's Highness in
the Parliament to be holden at Westminster on the 8th of May next ensuing
the date hereof, I the same Dorothy Pakington do ratify and
approve to be of my own act as fully and wholly as if I were witness or
present there. In witness whereof, to these presents, I have set my seal,
this 4th day of May, in the 14th year of the reign of my Sovereign Lady
Elizabeth, by the grace of God, of England, France, and Ireland, Queen,
&amp;c." Aylesbury was made a borough town by a charter of Queen Mary,
in 1554. The Reform Bill has made no alteration in the number of members.
The electors are those of the old constituency, consisting of freeholders
of the hundred, and house-keepers not receiving alms; the
freeholders of the hundred are estimated at 838; and the ten pound
householders at 314; total 1152. The limits of the borough are unaltered,
and the returning officers are the constables of the borough. The town is also
one of the polling places for this county, which now returns three members.
The county gaol is still at Aylesbury, but the Summer Assizes were restored
to Buckingham, through the exertions of Lord Cobham and the Grenville
family in the year 1758. The only manufacture at Aylesbury is that of
lace-making: the weekly market is a very plentiful one for provision, and
much business is done here at the annual fairs.</p>

<p>[A] AYLESFORD is seated on the banks of the Medway, by which the
parish is divided. The church is so singularly situated, from being placed
on a rising ground, that persons in the churchyard can almost look down
the chimnies of the houses. The neighbourhood is famed as having been
the spot where, we are told by ancient historians, a sanguinary battle was


<span class="sidenote">The site of
a Saxon
battle.</span>


fought in 445, between the Britons and Saxons; the conflict having
taken place about five years after the first landing of the latter in Britain.
It appears from our chronicles that Vortimer, then monarch of this island,
having first defeated his enemies on the banks of the Darent, in Kent,
pursued their routed forces to Aylesford; at which place the Saxons had
passed to the eastern side of the Medway, where a most obstinate and
bloody battle took place between the contending armies, when the fate of
the day, having long remained undecided, at length terminated favourably
for the Britons. In that decisive affair, Horsa, brother of Hengist, the
Saxon chief, and Catigrinus, brother to King Vortimer, are said to have
contended hand to hand, when both died bravely upon the spot. Horsa,
if tradition may be credited, was interred about three miles north of Aylesford,
at a spot still bearing the name of Horsted; that is to say, "the
place of Horsa;" where, in the adjoining fields, large stones are still
dispersed over the soil; some in erect positions, while others, from lapse
of time, have been thrown down; being, there is little doubt, placed there
as memorials of the Saxon warriors slain in that famous encounter.
Prince Cartigrinus is supposed to have been inhumed still nearer the field
of slaughter, on the summit of an acclivity, about one mile north of Aylesford,
and a quarter of a mile west from the high road leading from Rochester
to Maidstone; at which place, Kitt's Cotty House still stands, as


<span class="sidenote">Kitt's Cotty
House.</span>


represented in our engraving. This memorial consists of four large stones,
of the pebble kind, two placed in the ground, being partly upright, forming
two sides, a third standing in the middle between them, while the fourth,
being the largest, is laid transversely over them, thus forming a covering.
None of these stones bear the imprint of the chisel, or any sign whatsoever
of manual labour. Alfred and Edmund Ironside defeated the Danes in
this vicinity. Sir Charles Sedley, of poetical and dissolute notoriety, was
a native of this place; as was also Sir Paul Rycaut, the celebrated eastern
traveller.</p>

<p>[A] AYLSHAM is situated on the southern side of the river Brue, which
is navigable hence to Yarmouth, for barges of about 13 tons burthen.
Aylsham during the reigns of Edward II. and III., was the chief town in
this part of the kingdom for the linen manufacture; but in succeeding


<span class="sidenote">Trade.</span>


reigns, that business was superseded by the woollen manufacture; and
in the time of James I., the inhabitants were principally employed in
knitting worsted stockings, breeches, and waistcoat pieces. Since the introduction
of frame knitting, that trade has also been lost; the town is
governed by a bailiff. Aylsham church is said to have been erected by
John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the court of which duchy was at one
period held here. There is a spa in the neighbourhood, the water of
which has obtained considerable reputation for its medicinal properties in
chronic disorders.</p>

<p>[B] AYNHO is a large and respectable village seated on a rock, below
which issues a powerful spring of water, called the Town Well, which


<span class="sidenote">Town Well.</span>


after running through the vale below, contributes to the supply of the

belong to the Cartwright family, who have long been in possession of the
manor, and whose descendant R.W. Cartwright, Esq., has a handsome
seat, the interior of which is adorned with a fine collection of paintings.
An hospital was founded here for poor and sick travellers. The building

<p>[A] AIRE, (The) rises from a small lake on the moors of Yorkshire,
north-east from Settle, descending through Aire-dale and Craven in its
course to the south-east, which it pursues as far as Leeds, where, turning
eastward, and meeting the Calder, it passes under Ferrybridge, flowing
through the flattest portion of Yorkshire; and receiving the Don, a little


<span class="sidenote">Booth
Ferry.</span>


north of Snaith, it unites with the Ouse above Booth Ferry, near Howden.
This river is of greater extent than the Calder, and much its superior in
navigation, being also joined by numerous canals from the west. Its
origin is almost mountainous, in the midst of the wildest moors; and
Aire-dale retains much of the same characteristic features of that line of
country. The district of Craven is singularly romantic, being a rich
vale, bounded by high hills, with the town of Skipton in its centre; below
which it forms a beautiful valley to Keighley, full of trade and population;


<span class="sidenote">Kirkstall
Abbey.</span>


the Aire passes the picturesque ruin of Kirkstall Abbey, in its way to Leeds,
the manufactories and villas of which flourishing place, and its vicinity,
encompass its banks; after which it divides one of the richest plains in
the kingdom to Ferrybridge, not far from the eminence where the town of
Pontefract appears a conspicuous object, with its ruined castle and ancient
church. Afterwards the Aire can boast little of beauty, as it advances
through a level district to join the Ouse.</p>




<p>[B] ALNE, (The) is a small river which rises on the border of Roxburgshire,
but within the limits of Northumberland, and a little north of the
source of the Coquet. The great and attractive objects which grace its
borders are placed in the far-extended territory of the Duke of Northumberland,


<span class="sidenote">Brisley
Tower.</span>


at the entrance to which the lofty building, called Brisley Tower,
thickly environed by plantations, overlooks all the wild country of Northumberland,
including the bold range of Cheviot-hills on the north-west,
close to the Scottish border. The Alne then enters a charming valley,
beneath the ivied walls of Hulne Abbey, winding delightfully between
lawns, woods, and groupes of trees and cottages, admirably disposed.
From these monastic and rustic recesses, the river emerges into a spacious
park, widened considerably by art, and gliding through the arches of a fine


<span class="sidenote">Alnwick
Castle.</span>


Castellan bridge, is proudly overlooked by the numerous towers, and lofty
citadel of Alnwick Castle, the superb seat of the Northumberland family.</p>


<p>[C] ANCHOLME. This small river, rising in the wolds of Lincolnshire,
not far from Market Raisin, is navigable from Glandford Bridge to the
Humber, and in its course intersecting the extensive tract of the Wolds,
which stretches out from Lincoln northward to Barton, and forms a
ridge across some intermediate valleys, terminates in the fens near Spilsby
Louth. Brocklesby Park, in the extensive domains of Lord Yarborough,
occupies the centre of this district, on the highest point of which his
lordship has built a superb chapel and mausoleum, in a very excellent
Grecian taste, adorned with appropriate statues and marbles, from Italy.
This building, from its position, commands the whole surrounding country,
with the port of Hull, across the Humber; forming also a sea-mark, and
an interesting object, admirable for the elegance of its design and execution.
Thornton College is a curious remnant of antiquity in this neighbourhood,
founded in the reign of King Stephen; great part of which is
yet preserved, with some modern additions.</p>


<p>[D] AVON, (The Upper) rising in Northamptonshire, on the borders of
Leicestershire, adds great beauty to the delightful territory of Warwick
Castle, as it flows beneath the cliff on which those lofty towers projecting


<span class="sidenote">Warwick
Castle.</span>


before the town and church are situated. It then glides through a
charming country to Stratford-on-Avon, celebrated as the birth-place
of Shakspeare, and where the remains of the immortal bard are deposited.
From thence it traverses the great level of Worcestershire by Evesham,
having received the lesser Stour at Stratford, and turning to the South at
Pershore, meets the Severn at the flourishing town of Tewksbury.</p>


<p>[E] AVON (The Lower) rises in the hilly district of North Wiltshire,
bordering on Gloucestershire, not far from Wootton Basset; its source is
near that of the great river Thames, and both are said to have their origin
from various springs, not accurately defined. Emerging from the hills, it
makes a compass to fall into the vale leading from Christian Malford


<span class="sidenote">Bath.</span>


to Chippenham, advancing through the cloathing district of Wiltshire,
bordering upon that of Somersetshire, and for a considerable extent
divides those counties. Its course is at first southward, making a long
compass by the west towards the north, and then to the west; at last,
encircling the city of Bath on two sides, from whence it pursues nearly
the same direction, with frequent meanders to Bristol. It then inclines to
the north-west, as it conveys the abundant trade of that opulent city to
the Severn, by its conflux constituting the Bristol Channel at King's-road.</p>

<p>[A] BABINGLEY. In this parish, the first Christian church in East
Anglia is said to have been built. Several hills in the vicinity, called
Christian Hills, render the opinion highly probable. The village is
situated near that part of the Lincolnshire wash called Lynn Deeps.</p>


<p>[B] BABRAHAM, anciently Badburham, is situated in the hundred of Chilford.
This place, which was one of the manors of Algar, Earl of Mercia,
at the time of the Norman survey, formerly had a market on Mondays.
About the year 1576, the whole manorial property in the parish fell into
the possession of Sir Horatio Palavicini, a Genoese. According to the


<span class="sidenote">Singular
anecdote of
the Pope's
Tax-gatherer.</span>


tradition of the neighbourhood, this gentleman was collector of the Pope's
taxes in England, in the reign of Queen Mary, on whose death, and the
consequent change in religion under Elizabeth, he (like the Vicar of Bray,)
changed his faith, converted the Pope's money to his own use, and settled
in this country. The following whimsical epitaph relates to this occurrence:
it is printed in "Lord Orford's Anecdotes of Painting"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Here lyes Horatio Palavazine,<br />
Who robbed the Pope to lend the Queen.<br />
He was a thief&mdash;a thief? Thou lyest:<br />
For what! he robb'd but Antichrist,<br />
Him death with besome swept from Bab'ram.<br />
Into the bosom of ould Abraham:<br />
But then came Hercules with his club,<br />
And struck him down to Belzebub."
</p>

<p>Sir Horatio was in great favour with Queen Elizabeth. He was naturalised,


<span class="sidenote">The Queen's
favorite.</span>


by patent, in 1516, and commanded one of the English men-of-war
in the great battle with the Spanish Armada, in 1588; and he was
employed by the Queen, in her negotiations with the German Princes:
he died at his seat, in this parish, on the 6th of July, 1600. It appears
by the register kept in the church, that his children were baptized and
buried here: it is also recorded, that the marriage of Sir Horatio's widow
with Sir Oliver Cromwell, the Protector's uncle, took place exactly a
year and a day after her husband's decease. The poor of this parish are
partly maintained by a bequest of &pound;97. a year, expended under certain
restrictions imposed by the donor. Here is an alms-house, and a free
school, founded by Levinus Bush, Esq., and his sister, Mrs. Judith
Bennet; and the yearly sum of &pound;25. is appropriated to the apprenticing
of children.</p>

<p>[A] BABWORTH. The hall is the seat of the Hon. J.B. Simpson; it
a plain white-fronted edifice, the surrounding grounds which are
very beautiful, were laid out by the celebrated Repton. Babworth church
is a neat gothic building, with a small steeple; it is worthy of remark,


<span class="sidenote">Trees grow
out of the
roof of the
church.</span>


that there are two trees growing out of the roof of the south porch. Near
this village the ground begins to rise, and displays the most enchanting
scenery of woods, lawns, glades, heaths, cultivated farms, and ornamental
seats. The late Paul Sandby, Esq., R.A., who died on the 8th of November,
1809, was descended from a branch of the Sandby family, of Babworth,
and was born at Nottingham, in 1732. In 1746 he went to London,
and having an early bias towards the arts, he got introduced into
the drawing room of the Tower. After two years he was appointed
draughtsman, under the inspection of Mr. David Watson, who was employed


<span class="sidenote">Paul Sandby,
Esq.</span>


by the late Duke of Cumberland to take a survey of the Highlands.
During this excursion he made several sketches from the terrific scenery of
that romantic country, from which he afterwards made a number of small
etchings, which were published in a folio volume. From this circumstance,
perhaps, we may account for the bold and striking style by which the
paintings of this excellent artist are so peculiarly distinguished. In 1752,
he quitted this employment and resided with his brother at Windsor.
Several of the most beautiful views in the neighbourhood of Windsor and
Eton, now became the subject of his pencil; here also he obtained that
skill in depicting gothic architecture which gave so beautiful an effect to
those landscapes that Sir Joseph Banks purchased them all at a very
liberal price. Mr. Sandby published several prints in ridicule of the inimitable
Hogarth's "Analysis of Beauty," but he afterwards declared,
that had he known the merits of that exquisite painter at the time, he


<span class="sidenote">Sandby the
painter.</span>


should not have dared to depreciate them. On the institution of "the
Royal Academy," he was elected one of the Academicians. He was afterwards
appointed chief drawing master of the Royal Academy at Woolwich,
and held the office with honour and credit to the day of his death.</p>

<p>[A] BADBY. This extensive village is situated on the brow of a hill, in
the large uninclosed district of Badby-Down. Here are numerous springs,


<span class="sidenote">Quarries.</span>


and several quarries of flag-stone, which, from its excellence, is very extensively
employed for the purposes of building and paving. On the
summit of Arbury Hill, in this parish, is a large encampment, which is
attributed to the Romans: the ramparts are very steep, and the whole is
encompassed by a very wide and deep foss.</p>


<p>[B] BADDESLEY. This village was celebrated a short time ago for a
singular tree it contained, from which was frequently heard to issue groans
as though uttered by a person in acute agony. The tree was an elm,
young, vigorous, and to all appearance perfectly sound; and what is most
wonderful, naturalists could assign no physical reason for the phenomena.
Its fame spread far and wide; a pamphlet was written with an account of
it, and persons came miles to visit it. The tree, however, it would seem


<span class="sidenote">The groaning
tree.</span>


with the fickleness attendant too often upon those who have gained celebrity,
would not always groan, yet no cause could be assigned for its
temporary cessations, either from seasons or weather. Many superstitious
tales were raised by the country people and alleged as reasons for
this singular occurrence; and for eighteen or twenty months it continued
an object of considerable interest; a gentleman of the name of Forbes,
making an experiment to discover its cause, by boring a hole in its trunk,
put a period to its agonies, it never groaned again. It was afterwards
rooted up with a further view to make a discovery, but in vain. It is universally
believed that there was no trick in the affair, but that some natural
cause really existed, though never understood.</p>



<p>[C] BADDILEY. A parish in the hundred of Nantwich. This place is
principally remarkable for its church, standing on a small green surrounded
by farm buildings. It consists of a small nave and chancel, and was constructed
entirely of English oak; it is of the most remote antiquity, and
presented a most unique specimen of ecclesiastical buildings of timber,
previous to the introduction of stone; the upright timbers being much


<span class="sidenote">An oaken
church.</span>


decayed were cased with brick in 1811, it having stood so many centuries
that it was in danger of falling; the roof and ceiling are still in fine preservation.
In the chancel are remains of some ancient stalls, and two
elegant marble monuments, erected to the Mainwaring family, who were
lords of the manor. Baddiley Hall, the former residence of this family,
was a very old irregular building of timber and plaister, but has been
lately pulled down.</p>



<p>[D] BADDOW. (Great). This extensive, populous, and genteel village,
from its peculiarly delightful situation, has become the residence of a considerable
number of highly respectable families. Previous to the conquest,
the manor was part of the possessions of Algar, Earl of Mercia. In consequence,
however, of the rebellion of his son and successor, Earl Eadwine,
who was slain in battle, this lordship, with other estates, was granted
by King William to the monastery of the Holy Trinity at Caen, in
Normandy. In the reign of Henry I., the crown was again possessed of
it, and about the same period, the Earls of Gloucester became its proprietors;
from which time, after having been vested in many noble
families, it is now in the possession of the family of Houblon. Two
chauntries of some value were formerly in the church.</p>

<p>[A] BADDOW, (Little). The church at this place contains a rich and
splendid monument to the memory of Sir Henry Mildmay, Knight, who


<span class="sidenote">Sir Henry
Mildmay.</span>


died in October, 1639. He is represented in a full suit of armour, reposing
under a dome, which rests upon black marble pillars; two female
figures kneel at his feet; the one elderly, and dressed in a scarf and hood,
the other young, and magnificently attired in the fashion of the time.
The head of the knight is supported by a pillow. From a latin inscription
upon an oval tablet, we learn that Sir Henry having served as a soldier in
the Irish wars, was for his gallantry knighted in the field. The carved
effigies of two female figures, said by tradition to have been sisters and
founders of this church, occupy recesses in the south wall of the centre
aisle. Upon examining the two graves in which it was supposed that


<span class="sidenote">Skeletons
found.</span>


the corpses of the persons whose figures stood in the niches were interred,
in one of them were found three skeletons, and two in the other, but
without the slightest vestige of wood, linen, coffin, or any other covering
to the bodies. In the year 1817, Edward Bullin, Esq., bequeathed 196
acres of land, and a wood containing thirty-six acres, for the purpose of
clothing and educating the children in this parish and that of Boreham.</p>



<p>[B] BADLESMERE. Bartholomew de Badlesmere, lord of the manor in
the reign of Edward the Second, obtained a license for founding a house
of regular canons in this place. The church is a small and very plain


<span class="sidenote">Curious
carvings in
wood.</span>


Saxon structure. In the porch are the fronts of two ancient wooden
seats, carved in high relief; one represents a shield, on which are the
star, ribbon, and motto of the order of the garter: on the other are some
Scriptural sentences, relative to the Holy Trinity, in four circles, united
by bands; so that the words Pater, Filius, Spisces and Deus, though only
once repeated in the circles, form a part of every sentence.</p>



<p>[C] BADMINTON, (Great) has been the seat of the ducal family of Beaufort,
ever since the demolition of Ragland Castle, in the civil wars. Badminton


<span class="sidenote">Duke of
Beaufort's
seat.</span>


House, the family residence of the duke, is situated in a noble
park nearly nine miles in circumference, through which various avenues
have been formed. It was erected by the first duke of Beaufort in the
year 1682. It is a very extensive building, on the French model. In the
hall is a large sarcophagus of Roman sculpture, representing a bacchanalian
procession; this was given to the third duke of Beaufort, by Cardinal
Alberoni. By that distinguished prelate, who died in 1745, many
curious and original paintings were procured during his residence in Italy;
among them is a Holy Family, by Raphael; and several by Guido and
Carlo Dolci are much esteemed. He also purchased the very singular and
finely painted satirical picture by Salvator Rosa, for which that artist was
expelled Rome. "The Sovereigns of the different nations are here depicted
by different animals, as an eagle, a wolf, a sheep, a hog, a fox, a cow, and
an ass; the latter has the pontifical pall thrown over him, and the blind
goddess, Fortune, is represented showering her gifts over the whole group."
Some excellent landscapes, by the Italian masters, are also preserved here;


<span class="sidenote">Fine
paintings.</span>


and a very fine series of fourteen portraits, of the Beauforts, from John of
Gaunt, from whom they trace their genealogy. Badminton church is an
elegant structure; it was built by the late duke in 1785, and contains
many monuments of the Beaufort family.</p>

<p>[A] BAGINTON. The Hall, a seat of a descendant of the Bromley
family, who purchased the estate in the reign of James I., was built by
secretary Bromley. This gentleman, one of the most honest and able
servants of Queen Anne, was Speaker of the House of Commons. In
proof of the high estimation in which he was held, it is necessary only to
cite a memorable circumstance relative to the residence under notice. In


<span class="sidenote">Once destroyed
by fire.</span>


1706, the family seat at Baginton was reduced to the ground by fire.
Intelligence of this calamity was conveyed to the owner while attending
his duty in the House of Commons, and a considerable sum was immediately
voted by parliament towards a restoration of the structure. Here
is barely to be traced the site of the castellated residence of Sir William
Bagot, a firm adherent of Richard II., at which the Duke of Hereford,
afterwards Henry IV., lodged the night previous to his projected personal
contest with Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, in the presence of the
King on Gosford Green, where the lists were formed; the scene is admirably
described by Shakespeare.</p>




<p>[B] BAGLAN is a parish in the hundred of Neath. The village is of the
most romantic beauty, and the scenery in the neighbourhood is of a
delightful character. Near this place is Britton Ferry, which is interesting,
not only on account of its sylvan fascinations, but as being the domain
of Lord Jersey, whose extensive plantations spread over several bold hills


<span class="sidenote">Lord Jersey's
seat.</span>


westward of the Neath river, a stream which here emerges in a fine sweep,
between woody banks, partly broken into cliffs and at a short distance
descends into the sea. "From a delightful shady walk over the
stream, we branched off," says Mr. Barber, "into an 'alley green,'
which led us up a steep hill, covered with large trees, and tangled underwood;
the ascent was judiciously traced, where several bare crags,
projecting from the soil, formed an opposite contrast to the luxuriant verdure
which prevailed around. On gaining the summit, the charms of
Britton Ferry disclosed themselves in 'an ample theatre of sylvan grace,'
of more than common beauty: beyond which, the Bristol Channel,


<span class="sidenote">Britton
Ferry.</span>


bounded by the aerial tint of its opposite coast, formed the distance.
From this roaming prospect, however, the eye gladly returned to gaze on
the local beauties of the scene, the tufted knoll, the dark glade, and the
majestic river." The mansion is a very ordinary building; the house is
low having two wings, with attic windows in the roof, ornamented with
a bullustraded parapet. The neat simplicity of the hamlet deserves remark;
perhaps the church is unrivalled, both for its picturesque situation,
and moral interest. The custom of planting evergreens over the remains


<span class="sidenote">Planting
evergreens
over graves.</span>


of departed friends, and bedecking them with flowers at certain seasons of
the year, is here attended to with peculiar care; and to this pleasing
tribute of tenderness and affection the "Bard of Avon" refers in the
following beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"With fairest flowers while summer lasts,<br />
I'll sweeten thy sad grave, thou shalt not lack<br />
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose: nor<br />
The azured harebell, like thy veins: no, nor<br />
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,<br />
Out-sweetened not thy breath."
</p>

<p>David Ap Gwillym also beautifully alludes to this practice: "Oh, while
thy season of flowers, and thy tender sprays thick of leaves remain, I
will pluck the roses from the brakes, the flowers from the meads, the vivid
trefoils, beauties of the ground, and the gaily smiling bloom of the verdant
herbs, humbly will I lay them on the grave of Ivor!" This part of Wales
is so mild in its climate, that myrtles, magnolias, and other tender exotics,
grow luxuriantly in the open air. Near Baglan is a well with medicinal
properties, but many superstitious notices are associated with its use in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>[A] BAGSHOT is a village on the great western road, in the parish of
Windlesham, and hundred of Woking. Bagshot heath derives its name
from this village; it is one of the most extensive wastes in the kingdom,
and was formerly the scene of many highway robberies. Its appearance
is extremely desolate, but it is useful in supplying the inhabitants with
fuel, and feeds a great number of sheep, the mutton of which is excellent;
but like other animals fed on a similar pasture, the sheep are small. On the
edge of the heath are several noblemen's seats. Among which, Hall Grove,
the residence of Mrs. Birt; Chobham Place, S. Thornton, Esq.; South
Hill Park, the Earl of Limerick; and Easthampstead Park, the seat of the
Marquis of Downshire; are deserving the notice of the curious traveller.


<span class="sidenote">Bagshot

Bagshot Park to the north of the village, was once the seat of his late Majesty
George IV. when Prince of Wales; after which time it was inhabited
by the late Duke of Gloucester, (brother-in-law of his present Majesty)
until the day of his decease, which occurred on the 30th of November,
1834, in the 58th year of his age; his remains were interred in St.
George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on the 11th of the following month.
Bagshot was formerly a lordship of the kings of England, and was much
resorted to by James I., and Charles I., to enjoy the pleasures of the
chace.</p>

<p>[A] BAKEWELL. This ancient market town, in which the petty sessions
for the High Peak are holden, is situated on the western bank of the river
Wye. Of late years, the market has dwindled into insignificance, but the
parish is the most extensive in Derbyshire; its length is more than 20
miles, and its breadth upwards of eight. The pasturage in this neighbourhood
is remarkably good. The town was anciently called Bath-quelle;
it appears to have derived its name from its Bath-well, the immediate
site of which has been for many years occupied by a collector of
minerals and fossils for private cabinets. From the circumstance of a
Roman altar, and other antiquities having been discovered here, there can
be but little doubt that Bakewell was a place of some note in the time of
the Romans. At the Conquest, Bakewell had two priests and a church.
The manor then belonged to William Peverell, ancestor of the Peveril celebrated


<span class="sidenote">Seat of the
Peverils of
the Peak.</span>


in the admirable romance by Sir Walter Scott, styled "Peveril
of the Peak." Bakewell church is an ancient structure, with a lofty
spire. Near the entrance of the town, from Ashford, is a mill, for the
carding, roving, doubling, spinning, and twisting of cotton, in which
some hundreds of persons of both sexes are employed; the mill was
erected by the late Sir Richard Arkwright, the founder of the cotton


<span class="sidenote">Sir Richard
Arkwright.</span>


trade in this neighbourhood. This distinguished character, whose perseverance
and admirable inventions raised him from one of the most
humble occupations in society&mdash;that of a barber&mdash;to affluence and honour,
was the youngest of thirteen children, and was born in the year 1732, at
Preston, in Lancashire. A considerable manufacture of linen goods, and
of linen and cotton mixed, was then carried on in that neighbourhood,
and Mr. Arkwright had an opportunity of becoming intimately acquainted
with the various operations; and being a man of superior powers, he
directed his thoughts to the improvement of the mode of spinning, which
had probably been conducted for ages without thought of change. The
first hint respecting the means of effecting this improvement, he said, he
accidentally received from seeing a red hot iron bar elongated, by being
passed between iron cylinders. The difficulties which he experienced
before he could bring his machine into use, even after its construction
was sufficiently complete to demonstrate its value, would, perhaps, have
for ever retarded its completion, had his genius and application been less
ardent. His pecuniary means were not such as to enable him to commence
business on his own account, and few were willing to incur the necessary
risk. At length, however, he secured the co-operation of some persons
who saw the merits of the invention, and were willing to assist his endeavours,
and he obtained his first patent for spinning by means of rollers
in the year 1769. To avoid the inconvenience of establishing a manufacture


<span class="sidenote">Cotton
mills.</span>


of this kind at the great seat of the cotton manufacture, as it then
existed, he removed to Nottingham, when, in conjunction with his
partners, he erected his first mill, which was worked by horses. This
mode being found too expensive, another mill on a larger scale was erected
at Cromford, the machinery of which was put in motion by water. Mr.
Arkwright soon effected many improvements in the mode of preparing the
cotton for spinning, and invented a variety of ingenious machines for that
purpose, in the most correct and expeditious manner, for all which he
obtained a patent in the year 1775, and thus completed a series of machinery
so various and complicated, yet so admirably combined as to
excite universal approbation. That all this should have been accomplished
by a single man, without education, without mechanical knowledge, or
even mechanic's experience, is truly extraordinary; and is, perhaps, equal
to any known example of the wonderful powers of the human mind, when
steadily directed to one object. However, at the same time that he was
inventing or improving the machinery, he was engaged in various undertakings
which might have been thought incompatible with other pursuits.
He was taking measures to secure himself a fair proportion of the fruits of
his industry and ingenuity&mdash;he was greatly extending the business&mdash;he
was introducing into every department of the manufactory, a novel system
of industry, economy, order, and cleanliness; the whole of which he so
effectually accomplished, that his example may be regarded as the origin
of almost all similar improvements. During this entire period, he was
afflicted with a violent asthma, which sometimes threatened the immediate
termination of his existence; and for some time previously to his death,
he was rendered incapable of continuing his usual pursuits, by a complication
of diseases, which, at length, deprived him of life at the Rock
House, Cromford, on the 23d of August, 1792. The honour of Knighthood
was bestowed on him by George III., in December, 1786, when he
presented an address to that monarch. Dr. Thomas Denman, an eminent


<span class="sidenote">Dr. Thomas
Denman.</span>


physician, was born at this place in 1733; after the death of Dr. William
Hunter, he was considered as the most eminent man of his profession.
Towards the decline of his life he gradually relinquished the more laborious
parts of his profession to his son-in-law, Sir Richard Croft, and
became a consulting physician. His death, which was very sudden, took
place on the 26th of November, 1815. He left two daughters and a son,
the latter of whom, adopting the legal profession, is now Lord Chief
Justice of the Court of King's Bench.</p>

<p>[A] BALA is situated at the outlet of the lake of the same name. It is a
clean and populous market town, consisting of one wide principal street, and
others crossing it at right angles. The houses are in general built very
low. The young women commonly go barefooted; they are however well
formed, and have little of the strong Welsh physiognomy. At this place is
carried on a great trade in woollen gloves and stockings. Just before the
entrance of the town is an artificial mount called "Tommen y Bala," (the
tumulus of Bala) which is supposed to be of Roman origin, and placed here
with a small castle on its summit to secure the pass towards the sea, which
is about twenty-five miles distant. Bala Lake, or Llyn Tegid, is a quarter


<span class="sidenote">The largest
lake in
Wales.</span>


of a mile south of the town; it is the largest lake in Wales, being about
four miles long, and in some places near a mile in breadth. At Bryn
Goleu, its depth is several fathoms. The scenery around is mountainous,
and it forms the principal attraction of the vicinity, yet it possesses none
of the grand discriminating traits of the lakes of Scotland or Ireland.
The overflowings of this lake are sometimes dreadful; but this only happens
when the winds rush from the mountains at the upper end. In
stormy weather, when swelled by torrents, the water is driven to the
height of eight or nine feet, covering great part of the vale of Edeirnion,
and almost threatening the town with destruction. In calm settled weather,
it has been so smooth as to be frozen over. The river Dee rises from
under Arran ben Llyn, the high mountain at the head of the lake; and
according to Giraldus Cambriensis, Drayton, and others, passes through
this immense body of water without deigning to intermix its waters, as
the Rhone is said to pass through the lake of Geneva, and the classic
Alpheus through the waters of the Adriatic. Hence it has been asserted,


<span class="sidenote">The lake
fisheries.</span>


that salmon are never found in the lake, or gwiniad in the river; it however
abounds with a variety of excellent fish, among which we may mention
pike, trout, perch, and eels. The fishery in the 13th century belonged
to the Abbey of Basingwerk; the whole property is vested at present in
Sir Watkyn Williams Wynne, Bart., who allows the fishermen to be occasionally
employed in attending fishing parties with a boat and nets, without
such privilege no person is allowed the use of nets; but angling is
freely permitted, and gentlemen as distant as from London visit this place
entirely for the sake of indulging in this amusement. Of the inns at Bala,
Mr. Hutton says, "although I have often only reposed one night at an
inn, yet from agreeable treatment and conversation, I found some regret
the next morning at parting; and though I saw the people but once, my
mind revolted at the idea of seeing them no more." The town of Bala is
governed by two bailiffs, and a common council, and the assizes are held
here and at Dolgelly alternately; it is likewise one of the polling places
for the county.</p>

<p>[A] BALBY. In this village George Fox, the founder of the Society of
Friends, or Quakers, held his first meetings. His father, who was a


<span class="sidenote">George Fox
the Quaker.</span>


weaver, gave him a very religious education; he was apprenticed to a
grazier, and much employed as a shepherd. From his earliest infancy he
displayed a tendency to enthusiasm, and no doubt his solitary employment
tended to confirm it. At the early age of nineteen he persuaded
himself that he was called to exercise his faculties, solely in the affairs of
religion. Forsaking his relations, he determined to devote himself to that
alone. Equipped in a leathern doublet, he wandered from place to place,
subsisting by the charity of those who received his doctrines. At length
he reached the metropolis, where, being discovered by his friends, he was
earnestly invited to return. This, however, he refused to do, and after
remaining with them a short time, he again betook himself to his itinerant
habits. He now walked abroad in retired places, fasting and studying
the Bible by day and night, and sometimes a hollow tree was his
habitation, book in hand, for a day together. In 1648, he publicly propagated
his opinions, commencing as public preacher at Manchester,
which place he frequently left to perambulate the adjacent towns, preaching
in the market-houses. About this time he began to adopt the manners
and habits which are peculiar to the society following his religious
opinions; nor was he free from the persecution which constantly follows
novelty, in any thing regarded as an innovation of a religious nature. At
Derby, the disciples of Fox were first denominated Quakers, from the


<span class="sidenote">His wanderings
and imprisonment.</span>


trembling delivery of their sentences, and their calls on the magistrates to
tremble before the Lord. In 1655, Fox was sent a prisoner to Cromwell,
who immediately liberated him upon ascertaining the peaceful nature of
his doctrines. He was, however, treated by the country magistracy with
great severity, from his frequently interrupting ministers, even during
divine service, and more than once the Protector, Oliver Cromwell, exerted
himself to obtain his freedom. A fast having been appointed on account
of the persecution of Protestants in foreign countries, he addressed a letter
to the heads and governors of the nation, descrying, in most forcible
terms, the impropriety of having recourse to severity of a similar nature at
home. Charles II. liberated him from prison in the year 1666, and from
that time they formally united as a "Society of Friends." Three years
afterwards he married the widow of Judge Fell, in the simple unostentatious
manner practised by the sect to the present day. His health,
however, was impaired by imprisonment and suffering, and he lived in a
more retired manner to the day of his death, which took place in the year
1690, in the 67th year of his age.</p>

<p>[A] BALDERSLEY. Near this village is an extensive common, called
Hutton Conyers Moor, on which there is a rabbit-warren; the inhabitants
have a right of estray for their sheep on this moor, in conjunction with
some other townships, and each township has a shepherd. The lord's


<span class="sidenote">Right of
Common.</span>


shepherd has a pre-eminence of tending his sheep on every part of the
common; and wherever he herds the lord's sheep, the several other shepherds
are to give place to him, and give up what is termed their hofiong
place, so long as they are depastured thereon. The lord's court is held
on the first of January; the shepherds attend the court, and each do
fealty by bringing a large apple-pye and a two-penny sweet-cake; each pye
is divided into two parts, and distributed by the bailiff between the steward,
the tenant of the rabbit-warren, and the shepherds of the townships, reserving


<span class="sidenote">Singular
custom.</span>


a portion however for himself. Each pye contains about a peck
of flour, and the bailiff measures them with a rule to see that they are of
the proper dimensions; should they not be so he threatens to fine the
town; he, however, has to provide furmenty (a food made by boiling
wheat in milk) and mustard. The furmenty is put into an earthen pot,
and the top of the dish placed level with the ground, all persons present
are invited to partake; those who do not accept the invitation are deemed
disloyal to their lord. Every shepherd is compelled to bring a spoon with
him, and in cases of neglect, or wilful pleasantry, they are obliged to sup
the hot furmenty from the pot, and the bystanders not unfrequently
plunge the offenders head into the mixture, as a matter of diversion.</p>



<p>[B] BALDOCK is situated between two hills, at the intersection of the
great north road, and the Roman Ikeneld street. It was formerly the
property of the Knights Templars, to whom Gilbert, Earl of Pembroke,
gave the site; it was then called Baudoc: but some antiquarians, with
little reason, derive its name from Balbec, a city in Syria, from which
this order of knights was expelled by the Saracens. It principally consists
of one long ancient street. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is a spacious
structure, and was built by the Knights Templars, and again partly
rebuilt in the early part of the fifteenth century. All the early portion of
this structure is of pure Roman architecture, and the latter of the florid
gothic. The steeple, which is octagonal, was rebuilt a few years ago. In
the church is a richly carved oaken screen, part of the ancient rood-loft,


<span class="sidenote">Sharks'
teeth found
in cutting

and a very curious font. In cutting through Baldock-hill, to form a new
road, a number of fossils, consisting of cornua ammonis, sharks' teeth,
&amp;c., were discovered. There is a curious custom in this manor. When
the Steward holds his Court Leet, the bell tolls, to summons the copyhold
tenants together, to do their suit and service at dinner, to which every
baker sends a loaf of bread, and every victualler a flagon of ale or beer.
The object of this custom is intended for the Court Leet to examine the
measures, as well as to judge of the quality of the articles of food.</p>

<p>[A] BAMBROUGH CASTLE is situated on the romantic coast of Northumberland,
near an obscure town of the same name; it stands upon a
triangular rock, high, rugged, and abrupt on the land side. But we leave
its description, which would be too lengthy, and turn rather to the account
of the benevolent institution founded in 1720, by Lord Crewe, Bishop of


<span class="sidenote">Seat of the
Bishop of
Durham.</span>


Durham, of which it is the seat. The keep of the castle is fitted up for
suffering seamen, and property which may have been rescued from the
fury of the ocean. Regulations were also adopted to prevent accidents on
the coast, and to alleviate misfortunes when they had occurred. A nine-pounder
placed at the bottom of the great tower, gives signals to ships in
distress; and in case of a wreck announces it to the Custom-house officers,
who hasten to prevent its being plundered. In addition to this,
during a storm, horsemen patrol the coast, and rewards are paid for the
earliest intelligence of vessels in distress. A flag is always hoisted when


<span class="sidenote">Noble
charity.</span>


any ship is seen in distress on the Fern Islands or Staples; or a rocket
thrown up at night, which gives notice to the fishermen of Holy Island,
who put off to the spot when no boat from the main can get over the
breakers. There has also been life-boats added to the establishment.
Within the walls of the castle are supported two free-schools, an infirmary,
thirty beds for shipwrecked sailors, and a granary, whence poor persons
are supplied with provision at the first price. There is also a library, the
books of which are circulated gratuitously for twenty miles round. This
philanthropic endowment has not been suffered to decay with the romance
of olden time, but the charitable intentions of the testator are fulfilled so as
to exhibit a lasting record of his active benevolence.</p>



<p>[B] BAMPTON. A market town, situated near the little river Batherme,
which flows into the Exe at about one mile distance. Mr. Polwhele considers
that this was a Roman station, and here, probably, the Romans had
artificial hot-baths. A chalybeate spring in this neighbourhood is much
celebrated for its medicinal qualities. John de Bampton, a Carmelite,


<span class="sidenote">John de
Bampton.</span>


who was the first who publicly read Aristotle in Cambridge, was born
here: he died in 1391. The manufactures of the place are serges and
pottery.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Market</i>, Saturday.&mdash;<i>Fairs</i>, Whit Tuesday, and last Thursday in October, for cattle.</p></div>



<p>[C] BAMPTON. Here are some slight remains of an ancient castle,
supposed to have been erected in the reign of King John. The celebrated
poet, John Philips, the son of Dr. Stephen Philips, archdeacon


<span class="sidenote">John Philips
the poet.</span>


of Salop, was born in this town, on the 30th of December, 1676,
and after the preliminary process of juvenile education, was sent to
Winchester, where he was distinguished by the superiority of his exercises,
and at school endeared himself to all his companions and
superiors: it is related of him, that he seldom mingled in the play of other
boys, but retired to his chamber, and indulged in the study of the poets and
of the ancient and modern classics, particularly Milton. In 1694, he was
removed to Christchurch, Oxford, where he finished all his University
acquirements; but Milton&mdash;the immortal Milton&mdash;continued to be his
uninterrupted day dream: and he might have exclaimed in the language
of that poet, I will study the magnificence of thy etherial phantasy,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"From morn till noon, from noon to dewey eve,<br />
When Urania visits my nightly<br />
Slumbers, or when morn purples the east."
</p>

<p>It is said that there was not an allusion in "Paradise Lost," drawn from any
hint either in "Homer," or "Virgil," to which he could not immediately
refer. While at Oxford he was honoured with the friendship of Mr. Edmund
Smith, author of the Tragedy of "Phaedra and Hippolitus;" and also with


<span class="sidenote">Philips's
poetical
works.</span>


that of the most polite and favoured of the gentlemen in the University.
His first poem was published in 1703, entitled, "The Splendid Shilling,"
which has the merit of an original design. His next poem, entitled
"Blenheim," which he wrote as a rival to Addison's poem on the same
subject, was published in 1705, and procured him the patronage of Mr.
Henry Saint John, afterwards Lord Bolingbroke. Independent of poetry,
Philips was an excellent botanist; in 1706 he produced his third
poem on "Cyder," founded on the model of Virgil's Georgics, a book not
only of entertainment but of science; and soon afterwards, a latin Ode,
"to Henry Saint John, Esq.," said to have been the poet's masterpiece.
"It is gay and elegant," says Dr. Johnson, "and exhibits several artful
accommodations of classic expressions to new purposes." At the time of
his illness, Philips was meditating a poem to be called "The Last Day;"
death put an end to so solemn and majestic a finale of genius. He died
at Hereford, of a lingering consumption, February 15, 1708, in the thirty-third
year of his age, and was buried in the cathedral of that city. Sir
Simon Harcourt, afterwards Lord Chancellor, erected a monument to his
memory in Westminster Abbey, the epitaph upon which was written by


<span class="sidenote">Character
and death.</span>


Doctor Atterbury. Philips was a gentleman of a modest and amiable
disposition, "and always praised without contradiction," (says Dr. Johnson)
"as a man, modest, blameless, and pious, who bore a narrow fortune
without discontent&mdash;and tedious and painful maladies without impatience;
beloved by those who knew him, but not ambitious to be known."</p>

<p>[A] BAMPTON. The river Lowther runs through this parish. Here is a
beautiful lake, called Haweswater, three miles long, and half a mile


<span class="sidenote">Haweswater
lake.</span>


broad; it is environed by lofty mountains, conveying to the mind a grand
and imposing appearance: its eastern side is sheltered by rocky eminences,
plentifully clothed with verdure, while the western side displays the open
fields, with all the sweet varieties of culture. A lead mine has lately been
discovered in the neighbourhood. The free grammar-school was founded
by Thomas Sutton, D.D., who vested in trustees the sum of &pound;500., collected
from estates out of the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark, and other
places. Here, also, three parochial libraries were established respectively,
in the years 1710, 1750, 1752, comprising about 800 volumes. Thomas
Gibson, M.D., who married the daughter of Richard Cromwell, Protector,


<span class="sidenote">Dr. Thomas
Gibson.</span>


was Physician-General of the army, and a native of this parish. He was
the author of a system of anatomy. The learned doctor, having laid the
foundation of his classical learning at a school in this county, he entered
as scholar at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1686. The study of the northern
languages about this period was particularly cultivated at the University,
and Mr. Gibson rigidly applied himself to that branch of literature, in
which he was assisted by Dr. Hicks. In a short time he translated into
Latin the "Chronicon Saxonicum," and published it together with the
Saxon original. Dr. Gibson had an early and strong inclination to
search the antiquities of his own country, and being well versed in the
knowledge of its original languages, he applied himself with great diligence,
and in a few years produced his edition of "Camden's Britannica,"


<span class="sidenote">An Antiquarian.</span>


and concluded this branch of learning with "Reliqu&aelig; Spelmannian&aelig;," or
the posthumous works of Sir Henry Spelman, relating to the laws and
antiquities of England, which, with a life of the author, he published at
Oxford, in 1698, and dedicated his work to Archbishop Tenison. About
this time he was taken as Domestic Chaplain to the Archbishop's family,
and soon afterwards was made Rector of Lambeth, and Archdeacon of
Surrey. Upon the death of the Archbishop, in 1715, Dr. Wake, Bishop
of Lincoln, succeeded him, and Dr. Gibson was appointed to that See;
and Dr. Robinson also dying, in 1720, Gibson was appointed Bishop of


<span class="sidenote">Made Bishop
of London.</span>


London. The ministry were so sensible of his great abilities, that a sort
of ecclesiastical ministry was committed to his charge for several years.
He died on the 6th of September, 1748, with true Christian fortitude, and
in perfect tranquillity of mind.</p>

<p>[A] BANBURY is pleasantly situated on the small river Charwell, and its
staple commodities seem to be cheese and cakes; the former, even in Shakspeare's
time, appear to have been celebrated, for Bardolph, when accused


<span class="sidenote">Cheese and
cakes.</span>


by "Slender" of robbing him of his two milled sixpences, exclaims, "You
Banbury cheese." The cakes have made this town more celebrated than
even its political engagements. The castle of Banbury was founded in the
year 1153, by Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and continued an episcopal
residence till the reign of Henry VI. During the contentions between the
houses of York and Lancaster, when civil discord was a familiar incident
in this neighbourhood, Banbury suffered much; but more particularly in
the memorable engagement, called "The Battle of Banbury," fought


<span class="sidenote">Battle of
Banbury.</span>


about three miles from the town, in 1469. It took place on a plane called
Danesmoor, near Edgecote. The Earl of Warwick was the commander
of the Lancasterian forces, and the Yorkists were led by the Earls of
Stafford and Pembroke, who had possession of the town. After one of
the most determined conflicts ever recorded, the Yorkists were routed;
the Earl of Pembroke and his brother were both taken and beheaded, and
Edward IV. himself made prisoner a few days after. In 1642, the towns-people
took part with the Parliament, but after the battle of Edgehill,
this castle was taken by the royalists, under Sir William Compton, who
defended it for 13 weeks against all the efforts of Sir John Fiennes, until
the garrison was relieved by the Earl of Northampton. It suffered a further
siege of 10 weeks, under Sir William Waller, and surrendered on
honourable terms. Leland, who wrote in the Reign of Henry VIII., says,
"In this castle is a terrible prison for convict men." A stone vault, with
grated windows, and traces of the inner ditch, is supposed to have been


<span class="sidenote">Once a
celebrated grammar<br />
school.</span>


the terrible prison alluded to, but very small remains exist in the present
day. The free grammar-school is now wholly abandoned, and the school-house
let out on lease by the corporation. This is much to be regretted,
as it was formerly held in such high estimation, that the statutes of this
establishment were taken as a model for St. Paul's school, London; and
the statutes of the free grammar-school of Manchester, in 1524, ordain,
that the grammar taught in that school, should be taught only "after the
manner of the school at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, which is called Stanbridge's
Grammar." Mr. Stanbridge, the celebrated grammarian alluded
to, was a highly learned man, and tutor to Sir Thomas Pope. Adjoining
the Ram Inn is a sulphurous well, and at a small distance from
the town is a chalybeate spring. The pyrites aureus, or golden fire-stone,
is frequently found in this neighbourhood. Among other interesting
remains about the town is an ancient hospital, dedicated to St.
John, now converted into a farm-house. This borough returns one
member to parliament, as it did before the passing of the Reform Bill.

<p>[A] BANGOR, which signifies the beautiful choir, is a Bishop's See; compared
to its former size, it is now but an inconsiderable place. It is
seated at the mouth of the Menai, near its opening to the Lavan sands,
in a narrow valley, between two low ridges of slate rock, opening to the
south, towards the majestic mountain, Snowdon, which rises 3571 feet
above the level of the sea. Mr. Warner, the intelligent Welsh tourist,
and his companion, spoke in raptures of this place. The beauty, repose,
and retirement of the whole pleased them wonderfully. The latter observed,
"If he were Bishop of Bangor, the only translation he would
covet would be, thence to heaven." The former agreed with him, that
"Were fate to throw him also into such a spot, very few attractions
would have sufficient force to elicit him from it." They had "Never
seen a place which united so many beauties in so narrow a circle." From
this city the new road finds its way through a low pass in the adjacent
ridge, and descends gently along the face of the sloping bank to the great
bridge: this road is very smooth and well protected, and worthy of the


<span class="sidenote">The suspension
bridge.</span>


magnificent scenery by which it is surrounded. Menai suspension bridge
is distant about two miles and a half from Bangor. This noble bridge is
substituted for the inconvenient ferry; it is 100 feet above the level of high
water, even at spring tides. The cathedral is a low plain building,
dedicated to St. Deiniol, to whom it owed its origin about the year 525,
and he was elected the first bishop in 550. He was the son of Dinothus,
Abbot of Bangor-iscoed, and reared under the auspices of a Welsh prince,
patron of the bard Talliesin, and perhaps the most liberal prince of his time.
In 1402 it was burnt down, during the rebellion of Owen Glendower; and
what is rather singular, it was suffered to remain in ruins during the space
of 90 years, when the choir was rebuilt by the Bishop in the reign of
Henry VII. But that cruel ravager of ecclesiastical property, Bishop


<span class="sidenote">Cathedral.</span>


Bulkeley, not only alienated the lands belonging to the cathedral, but
even had the audacity to sell the bells of the church. The choir is fitted
up in a style of neat and simple elegance, and ornamented with an excellent
organ, the gift of Dr. Thomas Lloyd, in 1779. The chapter consists
of a dean, three archdeacons, two precentors, two vicars choral, six minor
canons, six lay clerks, and eight choristers, with an income of &pound;2,000. per
annum. The windows of the cathedral were formerly very handsomely
ornamented with stained glass, but in the civil wars of Charles I. the
soldiers destroyed these, amongst other things. The most conspicuous
monument in this building is that erected to the memory of Owen Gwynedd,
one of the ancient princes of Wales. Here are several Dissenting meeting-houses,
and the town is the resort of many visitors during the summer
season; upwards of 50,000 annually are said to remain for longer or
shorter periods. Steam-packets ply between this place and Liverpool.</p>

<p>[A] BANGOR ISCOED is situated on the banks of the river Dee, which
here passes under a bridge of five arches. This place, at present very inconsiderable,
is famed on account of having been the site of the most ancient
monastery in the kingdom, founded by Lucius, the son of Coel, the first
Christian King of Britain, sometime previous to the year 180. This abbey


<span class="sidenote">The first
abbey established
in Britain.</span>


was remarkable for its valuable library, and the number of learned men
trained within its venerable walls. Gildas Ninnius, who lived in the 7th
century, was one of its abbots. He wrote in Latin an incorrect history
of England, which is still extant. According to Speed, this monastery,
in the year 596, contained no less than 2,400 monks, 100 of which passed
in their turns one hour of devotion; there are no remains of the
monastery existing.</p>



<p>[B] BANSTEAD is celebrated for the excellent herbage which the neighbouring
downs afford the sheep, which are highly prized for the delicate
flavour of the mutton. There are many elegant seats in the vicinity,
amongst which are Banstead House, Miss Motteux; Cold Blow Cottage,
General Sir Edward Howorth; and the Oaks, the seat of the Earl of


<span class="sidenote">Seat of the
Earl of
Derby.</span>


Derby. This celebrated villa was erected by a society of gentlemen, called
the "Hunter's Club," and the present noble proprietor can accommodate
his guests with more than 50 bed chambers; and a pack of hounds are kept
on the establishment, which has been long noted for its hospitality. On
the 26th of February, 1834, Mr. John Richardson, a farmer, returning
from Epsom to Banstead, was robbed and murdered on these downs.</p>



<p>[C] BANWELL is an agreeable village, situated under the northern
declivity of the Mendip hills, and is supposed to derive its name from a
spring strongly impregnated with mineral properties, which expands into
a fine sheet of water, and after turning two mills, empties itself into the
channel near the ruins of Woodspring Priory. The church, which is
a fine specimen of the florid gothic of the Tudor age, contains a
richly carved screen and rood loft, a beautiful sculptured stone pulpit,
and several windows of the richest stained glass. This manor has been


<span class="sidenote">Formerly a
Bishop's
Palace.</span>


in the possession of the Bishops of Bath and Wells, from the reign of
Edward the Confessor, with little exception, till the present time. They
had for many centuries a palace here, but nothing of it remains except a
private residence called Banwell Court, still interesting for its antiquity.
The park has been divided into enclosures, which afford at every point a
most pleasing variety of landscapes. The Bishop of Bath and Wells has
also a cottage ornee, for the accommodation of his family and of the numerous
visitors which are driven hither to view the two singular caverns
which have been discovered of late years in this neighbourhood. The
monastery of Banwell was founded by the early Saxon monarchs. Asserius,
or Asser, the scholar and biographer of King Alfred, was made
Abbot by that monarch. This Abbey was destroyed by the Danes; it
was afterwards restored, but never recovered its pristine importance; for
instead of arriving at the point of prosperity usual in Royal foundations,
it sunk into obscurity long prior to the dissolution of religious houses.
Banwell is remarkable for two extraordinary caverns discovered in the


<span class="sidenote">Extraordinary
caverns.</span>


year 1824, which occasioned no inconsiderable number of the curious to
resort to the village. They were first discovered by some workmen digging
a shaft in search of Calamine, which intersected a steep narrow fissure;
after they had descended about 80 feet it opened into a spacious cavern,
150 feet long and 30 broad, and about 30 feet high. This is called the
stalactite cavern, from the beautiful specimens of crystalized stalactite,
which lay covering huge fragments of rock about the floor. In this place
were found two pieces of candle, encrusted with lime, supposed to have
been left by the miners after working for ochre, calamine, &amp;c. A rich
vein of iron ore, with some cobalt and manganese, was also discovered,
the working of which has long since commenced, and the produce is conveyed
to the smelting works on the southern coast of Wales. The workmen,
in order to facilitate an easier method of entrance, opened another
fissure lower in the rock, when suddenly another cavern presented itself,
the floor of which was covered with a mass of sand, limestone, teeth,
bones, &amp;c. Professor Buckland, who surveyed this place, states, that a
shaft being driven into this mass, proved it to have been nearly 40 feet
deep. The bones consisted of various specimens of the ox tribe, including


<span class="sidenote">Antediluvian
bones.</span>


the elk. Skeletons of the wolf, and a gigantic bear, in point of preservation,
like what are to be found in ordinary churchyards&mdash;supposed
to be of antediluvian origin, where found here. In the roof of the cave is
a large chimney-like shaft, formerly rising to the surface, but now
blocked up by fragments of limestone, mud, and sand, adhering together
by incrustation, and through which dreadful pitfall, it is presumed, this
immense number of beasts were precipitated at the great inundation. The
rubbish has been partially cleared, and the bones are used to decorate the
sides of the walls. A British earthwork crowns the summit of the neighbouring
eminence, enclosing, within its irregular rampart, an area of about
20 acres; and, about a quarter of a mile further, is an entrenchment
nearly square, the ground in the centre of which is elevated in the form of
a cross.</p>

<p>[B] BARDNEY, anciently Beardanam, is situated in a marsh on the north
bank of the river Witham. An abbey was founded in the time of the Saxons,
prior to the year 641. Here Ethelred, divesting himself of the splendour of
royalty, retired to devote his days to religion, and became superior of the
monastery. King Oswald is said to have been buried here, but the body

was afterwards removed to the church of Gloucester. The hand was retained
by the monks as a relique, to which they ascribed the power of
working miracles, and for a long period imposed upon the credulity of
superstitious pilgrims. In the year 870 the monastery was burned by the
Danes, but was afterwards rebuilt by Gilbert De Gaunt, Earl of Lincoln,
who annexed to it several extensive estates. At the dissolution its annual
revenues were estimated at &pound;429. 7s.</p>

<p>[A] BARDSEY ISLE, is near the south-east point of the promontory of
Llyn, in Caernarvonshire: it is of a moderate elevation; in length two
miles, and in breadth one. The third part of its contents of 370 acres,
occupied by a high mountain, affords sustenance to a few sheep and
rabbits. It is about a league distant from the main land, and only accessible
to the mariner on its south-east side, where there is a small well-sheltered


<span class="sidenote">No reptiles
on this
island.</span>


harbour. There is no reptile ever seen on this island, except the
common water-lizard. The soil is clayey, but produces excellent barley
and wheat. The inhabitants are employed in cultivating the land, and in
fishing. The abbot's house is a large stone building, occupied by several
families, and near it is a singular chapel, or oratory, being a long arched
edifice, with a insolated stone altar near the east end. Dubricius, archbishop
of Caerleon, almost worn out with age, resigned his see to St.
David, retired here, and died in 522. He was interred upon the spot, but
such was the veneration paid to his memory in after ages, that about the
year 1107, his remains were removed, by the procurement of Urban, then
Bishop of Llandaff, and re-interred in the cathedral of that see, of which
he had been the first bishop. St. Dubricius was a man of singular eminence


<span class="sidenote">St. Dubricius.</span>


for learning and piety. He was Archbishop of Caerleon, and Metropolitan
of all Wales, in the time of Aurelius Ambrosius; and prior to
this elevation, he taught a school on the banks of his native river, which
was much resorted to from all Christian countries.</p>



<p>[B] BARDSEY, comprises the township of Bardsey, with Rigton and
Wathersome. Near the church is a mound called Castle Hill, supposed
to have been the site of a Roman fortress. At Bardsey Grange, in this
parish, resided occasionally, and died, Francis Thorpe, the tyrannical
Baron of the Exchequer; but the same house is rendered memorable as
the birth place of the poet Congreve, in 1670. This clever and celebrated


<span class="sidenote">Birth-place
of Congreve,
the poet.</span>


poet, was baptised in the church of this village in the month
of February of the same year. When an infant he was carried to
Kilkenny, by his father, who had the command of the army there.
He received his education in the school of Kilkenny, and from these
circumstances it is probable that persons had fallen into the erroneous
impression that Congreve was a native of Ireland. In 1685 he was admitted
into the university of Dublin. In 1691 he became a member of
the society of the Middle Temple, but soon relinquished the dry study of
the Law. At the age of twenty-one, he published his novel called "Incognita,"


<span class="sidenote">His works.</span>


or, "Love and Duty Reconciled." Soon afterwards, he brought
out the Comedy, called "The Old Bachelor," of which Dryden says,
"he never saw such a first play in his life;" it was performed in 1793,
with the most unbounded applause. Lord Falkland wrote the prologue.
The singular success and merits of this production, recommended him to
the patronage and notice of the Earl of Halifax, who settled him in an
office of six hundred a year, and during his life patronised him in every
way he could. His next piece was "The Double Dealer." On the death
of Queen Mary, in 1693, he wrote a Pastoral on the occasion, entitled "The
Mourning Muse of Alexis," upon the appearance of which King William,
her husband, granted him an annuity of &pound;100. per annum. In 1695, he
produced his Comedy, called "Love for Love;" and in 1697, the beautiful
Tragedy of "The Mourning Bride." Having lived a high and honorable


<span class="sidenote">Died in
Surrey-st.,
London.</span>


life amongst the most celebrated wits and classical men of the age, he
died at his house in Surrey-street, in the Strand, January 19, 1729. On
the 26th his corpse lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, at Westminster,
and the same evening was carried into Henry the Seventh's Chapel, and
afterwards buried in the Abbey. His pall was supported by the Duke of
Bridgewater, Earl Godolphin, Lord Cobham, Lord Wilmington, Hon.
George Berkeley, Esq., and Brigadier-General Churchill. Dr. Johnson
says, "He has merit of the highest kind; he is an original writer, who
borrowed neither the models of his plot, nor the manner of his dialogue."
And Voltaire remarks, "That he raised the glory of comedy to a greater
height than any English writer before or since his time."</p>

<p>[A] BARFORD, (Great). At this place is a piece of land, called White Bread
Close, left, as is generally believed, by one of the Shepherd family, formerly
residents of considerable opulence in the parish, for the purpose of
purchasing loaves of white bread, to be thrown among the populace from


<span class="sidenote">Curious
custom.</span>


the church porch. This whimsical custom at last became such a scene of
scrambling, fighting, and disorder, that it was prohibited by the curate,
and the money applied towards the purchase of coals for the poor, at
Christmas. The boys, and even men, seemed to have participated in this
sport, the same as at a game at foot-ball, or other play; and an old gentleman
in the adjoining village fully remembers taking an active part in
the scramble, and bearing off the wheaten loaf in triumph.</p>



<p>[B] BARFORD, (Little), is situated in the hundred of Biggleswade, and is
chiefly celebrated as the birth-place of Rowe, the dramatic poet, who was
born here in the year 1673. His father having designed him for the study


<span class="sidenote">Rowe, the
Dramatist.</span>


of the law, took him from school at the age of sixteen, and entered him
a student in the Middle Temple. He made considerable progress, and
was called to the bar, but Homer and Virgil had more charms for him
than either Coke or Littleton. He was strongly solicited by his friends to
practice, but nothing could overcome his affection for the muses; and his
play, the "Ambitious Step-mother," having been received with great applause,
he resolved to make poetry his profession. He had imbibed in his youth
the most noble sentiments of liberty, of which he gave a specimen in his
Tragedy of "Tamerlane." This was the second play that he wrote, and
until of late years it was usual to perform it on the 4th and 5th of November,
in commemoration of the gunpowder treason, and the landing of
King William. Mr. Rowe being out of all employment, went one day to
wait on the Earl of Oxford, Lord High Treasurer of England, when,
among other things his Lordship asked him, whether he understood
Spanish. He replied in the negative, and his Lordship said he would
advise him to learn it as soon as possible. Rowe took his leave, applied
himself to the study of that language, and expecting some lucrative employment,
again waited upon him. How great was his disappointment, when
his Lordship, on being informed of his acquisition, merely exclaimed,


<span class="sidenote">Anecdote.</span>


"How happy are you, Mr. Rowe, that you can now enjoy the pleasure
of reading "Don Quixote" in the original!" His death took place on the
6th of December, 1718, in the 45th year of his age, and he was buried
with great funeral pomp, in Westminster Abbey, where a handsome
monument is erected to his memory.</p>

<p>[A] BARKING, in the hundred of Beacontree. The name is derived, according


<span class="sidenote">Origin of its
name.</span>


to some writers, from the Saxon words Beorce&mdash;a birch tree, and
Ing&mdash;a meadow; but the most natural presumption is, that it takes its
name from Berging, signifying a fortification in a meadow, and which seems
to be borne out, as there is an encampment still to be traced, of the most
extensive dimensions, being more than forty-eight acres in the area; near
to which is a spring of fine water, which no doubt supplied the inmates.
In 870, Barking was burnt by the Danes, and the abbey destroyed, and


<span class="sidenote">Burnt by
the Danes.</span>


the nuns either murdered or dispersed. Soon after the conquest, King
William retired to this place, while the Tower of London was being
erected, not deeming it safe to continue in that city; and here he was
visited during the preparation for his coronation, by Earl Edwin, of
Mercia; Morcar, Earl of Northumberland; and many others of the
nobility, who swore fealty to him, on the restoration of their estates. It
is situated on the river Roding, which branches off in two different
streams, and unites with the Thames about two miles distant. Barking
Creek is navigable for ships of 80 tons burden, and the coal and timber,
together with the fishing trade, is carried on to a considerable extent.
About a hundred fishing smacks sail from this town. Near the creek is a
large flour mill, formerly belonging to the abbey; and in the vicinity of the
town are extensive potatoe grounds for the supply of the London market.
Barking is rather a dull town, from the want of a main thoroughfare; it
has the appearance of antiquity stamped upon it, particularly the market-house,
which is an extensive and ancient building of timber and plaster, of
the age of Elizabeth. Here is a town-hall and work-house. A free quay
for landing goods, subject to a table of regulations, and a spacious new
road from the Commercial-road, through Eastham and Wallend to
Barking. The church is dedicated to St. Margaret, and is a spacious
ancient structure, with a lofty embattled tower at the west end, having a
beacon turret at one corner. A free-school, which now occupies part of
the work-house, was founded by Sir James Campbell, in 1641, who bequeathed
a sum of &pound;666. 13s. 4d. for that purpose. John Fowke, Esq.,
bequeathed certain lands for the maintenance of eight boys in Christ's
Hospital, two of whom are chosen from this parish. The importance formerly


<span class="sidenote">Once a
town of
importance.</span>


attached to the town of Barking was almost entirely to be attributed
to the magnificent abbey that was established here in the year 670, by
Erkenwald, Bishop of London, for nuns of the Benedictine order: it was
dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This abbey was governed by a succession
of Abbesses, of noble, and even royal descent After the destruction of
the establishment by the Danes, in the year 870, it was again rebuilt in a
style of greater splendour than before, and on the death of King Edgar,
in 970, his queen became Abbess. From the earliest period to the time
of its dissolution, it may be said to have been a seminary for the principal
gentry of England. Its revenues amounted, at the suppression of the religious
houses, to &pound;1084. 6s. 2-3/4d. Destruction has done its worst to this
beautiful abbey, for at present little or nothing remains but the gateway,
an interesting object, and in good preservation; over which is a room,
called the Chapel of the Holy Ghost. This gateway was denominated
the fire-bell gate, from its having anciently contained the curfew; it
is a square embattled structure, with an octagonal turret at one of the
angles. The arch of the entrance is finely pointed, and enriched with
deeply receding mouldings; above is a canopied niche, under a fine gothic
window of three lights. Among the ruins of the abbey were discovered a
fibula, and a gold ring, on which were engraved, the Salutation of the
Virgin Mary, and the initials I.M. The tyranny exercised over the
tenants of this manor by the fraternity, would almost create a feeling of
surprise in our present liberal and enlightened age, were they not perfectly
well known in a thousand other instances. The manor of Clayhall was
held under the Abbess and convent of Barking, by the following services:
viz. that every tenant should come in person to the Abbey Church, on the
vigil of St. Ethelburg the Virgin, and there attend and guard the high
altar, from the first hours of Vespers till nine the next morning; and that
he should be ready at all times, with a horse and a man, to attend the
Abbess and her steward, when going upon the business of the convent,


<span class="sidenote">Singular
services by
which the
manor of
Clayhall
was held.</span>


any where within the four seas. And, lastly, that the Abbess should have
by way of herriot, upon the death of every tenant, his best horse and accoutrements:
these services, however, did not exempt them from the quit
rents. Besides the above tenure, there were other vexatious contingencies;
viz. one (Robert Gerard) was among other services, to gather a full measure
of nuts, called a pybot, four of which should make a bushel; to go a
long journey on foot once a year to Colchester, Chelmsford, Ely, or the
like distances, on the business of the convent, carrying a pack; and other
shorter distances, such as Brentford, &amp;c., and maintaining himself upon
the road. He was to pay a fine upon the marriage of his daughter, if she
married beyond the limits of the manor. If his daughter had an illegitimate
child, he was to make the best terms he could with the Abbess, for the
fine called Kyldwyte. It appears also, that he could not even sell his ox
fed by himself, without the Abbess's permission. Some of the tenants,
according to Blount, were obliged to watch and guard thieves in the
Abbess's prison. A few miles distant, in a glade in Hainhault Forest,
formerly stood an oak, famed through many centuries, and known by the


<span class="sidenote">Fairlop oak.</span>


name of Fairlop Oak. Its age is traced by the traditions of the country half
way through the Christian era. Part of this noble tree has been converted
into the pulpit of St. Pancras new church. Its rough fluted stem was 36
feet in circumference, and about a yard from the ground, divided into
eleven immense arms; yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak, but
rather that of a beech. Beneath its shade, which formerly overspread an
area of three hundred feet in circuit, an annual fair was held on the 2nd
of July, and no booth was suffered to be raised beyond the extent of its
boughs. The fair is still continued on the same spot the first Friday in
July.</p>

<p>[A] BARMING. Of this village the learned antiquarian, Mark Noble, was
rector. His principal works were a history of the College of Arms, a

Genealogical History of the Royal Families of Europe, Memoirs of the
Protectorate House of Cromwell; and, also, of the illustrious house of
Medici. On St. Thomas's Day there is an annual solicitation for charity,
and with the money raised loaves of bread are purchased, and distributed
to the resident poor. Great quantities of hops, cherries, and
filberts, are grown in this parish.</p>


<p>[B] BARMOUTH, near the conflux of the river Maw, or Mawddach, is a
village singularly situated; the houses are disposed, either among the
sand, in a low situation, or at different heights on the side of a huge

rock, like a part of the city of Edinburgh, and are said to resemble the
town of Gibraltar. These houses form eight tiers, to which there is
no approach, but by steps cut in the rock. The floors of one row
are about level with the tops of the chimnies immediately in front; so
that a person standing at his door may look down the chimnies of
the neighbourhood below. The first range regales the second with
its smoke, the second the third, &amp;c. till we arrive at the uppermost, which,
in a westerly wind, takes the mixed perfume of all. Barmouth is
the port of Merionethshire, not far from which the river Mawddach has
its commencement. "Proceeding along the banks of this river towards
Dolgelly," says Mr. Bingley, "when it was high water, the whole bed of
the river being filled, made the different landscapes in the scene appear
truly picturesque. The first two miles which lay along, what the inhabitants
of Barmouth call, the Beach, formed the most interesting part of
the journey. In the composition of the views, scarcely any thing appeared
wanting; there was every requisite of mountain and vale, wood, water,
meadows, and rocks, arranged in beautiful order. Beyond the beach, the
road winds at a little distance from the river, among the low mountains;
and from different stations, I had views of the most elegant and picturesque
landscapes, the river partly hidden by intervening mountains.
This stream is much diminished in width and depth: at present it will not
admit so much as a pleasure-boat to reach Dolgelly, which obliges company
to walk three-quarters of a mile to the town."</p>



<p>[C] BARNARD CASTLE. The castle from which the town appears to
have derived its name, was founded by Barnard, son of Guy Baliol, who


<span class="sidenote">Guy Baliol.</span>


accompanied William the Conqueror to England, and to whom William
Rufus granted the noble forests of Teesdale and Marwood. Edward the
First, determined to mortify the Bishop of Durham and to abridge his
power; he, therefore, gave this castle to Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
in whose family it continued for five generations. It afterwards
came to the crown, and the tyrant Richard III. who took very great delight
in this place, contributed much to its beauty by the most tasteful embellishments;
his armorial bearings still appear, not only on the castle but
over many parts of the town, and it has been a crown domain ever since.
Hutchinson in his history of the county of Durham, describes the remains
of the castle as covering about six acres and three quarters of ground.
The parts which were of chief strength, stand on the very brink of a steep
rock, about eighty feet above the level of the river Tees, commanding a
most beautiful prospect up the river. The area on the side of the market-place,
appears not to have had any communication with the chief strongholds
and bulwarks of the fortress, and is separated from the interior
buildings by a deep fosse which surrounds the rest of the castle. In an
adjoining ground called the Flatts, is a large reservoir cut in swampy
ground; water was collected and conveyed to the castle in pipes, to supply
the garrison and cattle enclosed within the walls of the outer areas in
times of public danger. This area is now a pasture for sheep, and other
parts enclosed by the walls have been converted into orchards.</p>

<p>[A] BARNBROUGH. The church is dedicated to Saint Peter, and
contains a rude painting commemorative of "a serious contest that took
place between a man and a wild cat." This conflict, which every body
in Barnbrough firmly believes, is said to have occurred about the middle
of the fifteenth century, between Percival Cresacre, lord of the manor, and
a wild cat o' mountain. He is reported to have been attacked in one of
the little woods in the neighbourhood, by this furious animal, and a running
fight was kept up till they reached the church porch, where the
mortal combat ended in the death of both. That some such circumstance


<span class="sidenote">Contest between
the lord of
the manor and
a wild cat.</span>


did occur, is conjectured from the crest which the family afterwards
adopted, viz. a cat o' mountain, which is still to be seen on the tower of
the church; and the tradition is said to be further confirmed by the figure
of an animal at the foot of the oak statue of this Cresacre, and also a
rubiginous stone in the pavement of the porch of the church. We have
many evidences in history that cats were beasts of chase, particularly in
the charter of Ranulph Piperking, granted by Edward the Confessor:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the church is an ancient monument of Alicia Cresacre, wife of the

<p>In the north chancel is the monument of Percival Cresacre, a richly decorated
altar-tomb under a flat arch, at the crown of which is the family
arms, viz. three lions rampant, purple, on a gold shield. The effigies of
Cresacre is in fine preservation, composed of carved oak, and representing
a knight in a suite of plate armour, with his arms painted on a shield,
and an animal (supposed to be a lion) at his feet. His sword which hung
from his belt has been taken away, and both monuments are decorated
with the favorite device of the family, a rosary of beads.</p>

<p>[A] BARN-ELMS. On the adjoining common stood the house in
which the members of the celebrated Kit Cat Club assembled. Their


<span class="sidenote">Kit Cat
Club house.</span>


original place of meeting was in London, but Jacob Tonson, the bookseller,
who was their secretary, caused it to be transferred to a house
belonging to himself, at Barn-Elms, and built a handsome room for
their accommodation. The portrait of each member was painted by Sir
Godfrey Kneller, but the apartment not being sufficiently large to receive
half-length pictures, a shorter canvas was adopted, and hence proceeded
the technical term of Kit Cat size. We give a further account of this
club from the graphic pen of Sir Richard Phillips, in his "Morning's
Walk from London to Kew," 1817. "A lane in the north-west corner
of the common brought me to Barn-Elms, where now resides a Mr.
Hoare, a banker, of London. The family were from home, and I had
some difficulty to gain admittance, the servants knowing nothing either
of the club, or its former occupant. A walk covered with docks, thistles,
nettles, and high grass, led from the remains of a gateway in the garden
wall to the door which opened into the building. Ah! thought I, through
this desolate avenue, the finest geniuses in England daily proceeded to meet
their friends. Yet, within a century, how changed&mdash;how deserted&mdash;how
revolting! A cold chill seized me as the man unfastened the decayed
door, and I beheld the once elegant hall filled with cobwebs, a fallen


<span class="sidenote">As described
by Sir Richard
Phillips in
1817.</span>


ceiling, and accumulating rubbish. The door on the left led to a spacious,
and once superb, staircase&mdash;now in ruins. The entire building, for want
of ventilation, having become food for the fungus, called dry-rot, the
timbers had lost its cohesive powers. I ascended the staircase, therefore,
with a degree of danger to which my conductor would not expose himself,
but was well requited for my pains. Here I found the Kit-Cat Club-room,
nearly as it existed in the days of its glory. It is 18 feet high, and
40 feet long, by 20 wide. The mouldings and ornaments were in the
most superb fashion of its age, but the whole was falling to pieces from
the effects of the dry-rot. My attention was chiefly attracted by the
faded cloth-hangings of the room, whose red colour once set off the
famous portraits of the club that hung around it. Their marks and sizes
were still visible, and their numbers and names remained, as written in
chalk for the guidance of the hanger. Thus was I, as it were, brought
into contact with Addison and Steele, and Congreve, and Garth, and
Dryden, and with many hereditary nobles, remembered only because they
were patrons of those natural nobles. I read their names aloud&mdash;I invoked
their departed spirits&mdash;I was appalled by the echo of my own voice.
The holes in the floor, the forest of cobwebs in the windows, and a swallow's
nest in the corner of the ceiling, proclaimed that I was viewing a
vision of the dreamers of a past age; that I saw realized before me the
speaking vanities of the anxious career of man. On rejoining Mr. Hoare's
servant in the hall below, he informed me that his master intended to
pull the building down, and form of it a riding-house. I learn that this
design has since been executed. The Kit-Cat pictures were painted early
in the eighteenth century, and about the year 1710 were brought to this
spot, but the room I have been describing was not built till ten or fifteen
years afterwards. They were 42 in number, and are now in the possession
of a Mr. Baker, of Hertingford-bury, where I lately saw them
splendidly lodged, and in fine preservation. It may be proper to observe,
that the house of Mr. Hoare was not the house of Mr. Tonson, and that
Mr. Tonson's house stood nearer to the Kit-Cat club-rooms, having a few
years since been taken down." A person died in this place, leaving in his
will an annual sum, to be laid out in roses to be planted on his grave. The
spot is distinguished by a stone tablet on the outside of the wall of the
church, enclosed by pales, with some rose-trees planted on each side of
it. This tablet is dedicated to the memory of Edward Rose, citizen of
London, who died in 1653, and left &pound;20. to the poor of Barnes, for the
purchase of an acre of land, on condition that the pales should be kept
up, and the rose-trees preserved.</p>

<p>[A] BARNET. This small busy town occupies an elevated situation on
the high north road; and near this place was fought, in the year 1471, the
famous battle between the houses of York and Lancaster, which terminated


<span class="sidenote">Battle between

in the death of the Earl of Warwick, and established King Edward
the Fourth upon the throne. An obelisk was erected by Sir Jeremy
Sambrook, in memory of the battle in the year 1740. In the church is an
altar monument in commemoration of Thomas Ravensworth, Esquire,
whose effigy, in a recumbent position, is represented on the tomb in veined
marble. He died in 1630. Several others of his family are also buried
here; and among these, James, his eldest son, who erected and endowed
an alms-house, or hospital in Barnet, "for six poor ancient women, being
widows or maidens, inhabitants of the town; and neither common beggars,
common drunkards, back-biters, tale-bearers, common scolds, thieves or
other like persons of infamous life, or evil name or repute; or vehemently
suspected of sorcerie, witchcraft, or charming, or guilty of perjury: nor any
ideot or lunatic are admitted." The annual value of the original endowment
is now about &pound;45.; besides which, the trustees have a further income of
&pound;30. annually, arising from other sources. Another alms-house for six
poor widows, was built and endowed about the year 1723, under the will of
John Garrett, Gent., who bequeathed &pound;800. for that purpose. Near the


<span class="sidenote">Mineral
spring.</span>


race ground, on Barnet Common, is a mineral spring, of a mild purgative
nature, that was discovered about the middle of the 17th century, and
was formerly in much repute. A few years ago a subscription was made
for arching it over and erecting a pump. The town is at present governed
by a presiding magistrate, a high constable and subordinate officers. The
inhabitants of this township enjoy a very extensive common right over
the adjoining wastes and chace. Between Barnet and South Mims, an
extensive improvement has been effected in the road, which was a series
of angular turnings and unnecessary hills, to an extent which renders it
surprising how such glaring imperfections were suffered to exist, when a
sufficiently direct line could be obtained.</p>

was a native of this place, and was born in the year 1732.


<span class="sidenote">Birth place

About the year 1767, he joined with a Mr. Usher in setting up a school at
Kensington; this speculation not succeeding he removed to London, where
he gave lectures on elocution. It is said that in his early youth he studied
the art, intending to make the stage his profession, although his very
questionable success induced him to adopt another pursuit. Mr. Walker
was an amiable as well as a learned man; he was the author of several
elementary works: such as "The Rhetorical Grammar," "Elements of
Elocution," "Key to the correct pronunciation of Greek, Latin, and
Scriptural names," and a "Rhyming Dictionary." He died at his house
in Tottenham Court Road, August 1, 1807. This parish includes the
hamlet of Colney Hatch, half of Whetstone, and a part of Finchley
Common.</p>

<p>[A] BARNSLEY. This large market town is built chiefly of stone, but
being surrounded by coal pits and iron works, the smoke from which
obscures the air, it is generally known by the name of Black Barnsley.


<span class="sidenote">The trade.</span>


The black glass bottles made here are of excellent quality, and the manufacture
of linen is carried on to a great extent. Here also is made the
best wire in the kingdom for needles. The town is seated on the side of
a hill; the trade and population have considerably increased since the
completion of the navigable canal, by means of which communications
are opened with Wakefield, and all parts of the kingdom. The land in
the vicinity of this town is highly distinguished for its fertility; the manor
is possessed by the Duke of Leeds.</p>

<p>[B] BARNSTAPLE is said to derive its name from Bar, which in the
ancient British signified the mouth of a river; and the Saxon word Staple,


<span class="sidenote">Incorporated
by Henry I.</span>


a mart. It is situated in the hundred of Braunton, and returns two members
to parliament. The town appears to have been incorporated by
Henry I., yet it retains some traces of feudal jurisdiction; a number of
common burgesses claiming a right to vote with the corporate officers for
members of parliament. The &pound;10. householders are about 607; the returning
officer is the mayor, who with two bailiffs, two aldermen, twenty-two
common councilmen, and other officers form the corporation. Barnstaple
is one of the neatest and most respectable towns in the county; it
lies on the eastern bank of the river Taw, in a broad and fertile vale,
bounded by a semi-circular range of hills. The Taw here spreads to a
considerable breadth, but from the great accumulation of sand, the port is


<span class="sidenote">Amusements, &amp;c.</span>


shallow, and vessels of more than 200 tons are not able to enter. Over
the river is a bridge of sixteen arches, which is said to have been built by
one of the Tracys, at the time that family were lords of the manor. The
streets are spacious and regular, and the buildings generally good. The
town, indeed, boasts some of the marks of a metropolis; there are balls
every fortnight, and a regular theatre, and nothing but a good pavement
is wanted to make it highly agreeable. A noble quay extends some way
along the river, terminated by a handsome piazza, over the centre of which
stands the statue of Queen Anne, with an inscription, testifying to the
loyalty of Robert Rolle, of Stevenstone, in this county, the erector. The
woollen trade formerly carried on here with considerable spirit, greatly
increased the wealth of the town, and enabled its inhabitants to erect a
number of very respectable houses: this trade has of late failed, but the
manufacture of baize, silk stockings and waistcoat pieces, still gives life to
the place. Besides this source of wealth and population, the beauty of
the surrounding country, and the cheapness of provisions, have induced
many respectable families to reside here entirely; a circumstance which
renders Barnstaple the most genteel town in the north of Devon. Here
is a celebrated Grammar School, which has been founded about three
centuries, and is famous for having educated a number of distinguished


<span class="sidenote">Eminent
men educated

men; among whom were John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury: his Theological
antagonist, Thomas Harding, Professor at Louvain: the poet Gay,
and the learned Dr. Musgrave. Bishop Jewel was a learned divine, who
lived in the reigns of the last sovereigns of the house of Tudor, and was
born near Ilfracombe, in 1522. Having acquired the rudiments of his
learning in this school, he was removed to Merton College, Oxford. He
was a most zealous and able champion of the Christian faith; and was
indefatigable in the pursuit of knowledge, even at the expense of his health,
which was materially injured by the closeness of his application. About
the year 1551, he obtained the rectory of Sunningwell, in Berkshire,
where he was much beloved for his zeal and assiduity as a parish priest.
When Queen Mary succeeded her brother Edward, Jewel was deprived of
an office he held in the university; and, notwithstanding he subscribed to
a confession of faith drawn up by the Catholics, yet suspicions were entertained
of his sincerity, and fearing he should be prosecuted as an heretic,
he withdrew from Oxford, and made his escape to the continent. On the
death of Queen Mary, Jewel returned to England, and was received very
favorably by Queen Elizabeth, who raised him to the bishoprick of Salisbury,
in the year 1560. From this time until the day of his death, he was
principally engaged in his pastoral duties, and in the defence and support


<span class="sidenote">Gay, the
Poet, born

of the Protestant faith. He died September 1571. The admirable moralist
and poet, Gay, was also educated in this school; he was the composer
of "The Beggar's Opera," the notion of which appears to have
been afforded by Swift. The purpose of this singular performance, was
to bring into ridicule the Italian Opera, and it is not easy to define the
mixture of pathos and ridicule which distinguishes this remarkable production.
His celebrated "Fables," written for the instruction of the
Duke of Cumberland, have been the means of unqualified delight to millions.
His first poem, entitled "Rural Sports," and dedicated to Mr. Pope,
gained him the friendship of that poet. The year following he was appointed
Secretary to the Duchess of Monmouth: at this time he printed
his "Trivia," in the composition of which he was assisted by Swift.
He died of an inflammation of the bowels, in 1732, (sincerely lamented
by all who knew him,) and was buried in Westminster Abbey,
where his monument exhibits an epitaph by Pope, which is written with
tasteful tenderness.</p>

<p>[A] BARNWELL derives its name from some wells, which in the age of
superstition, were widely famed for the miraculous cures they performed
in diseases of children. Sacred veneration was at length paid them, and
pilgrims from distant parts resorted hither to adore the spirit which infused
such wonderful virtues into the waters. A castle was erected here
in the reign of Henry I., by Reginald le Moine, and became afterwards
the baronial residence of the family of the Montagues. The remains of
this once magnificent structure consist of four circular massy bastion
towers, each forming an angle of a quadrangular court, inclosed by walls
three feet thick; the grand gateway on the south side is flanked by similar
towers. The whole forms a fine and curious ruin, and is a rare specimen
of the early Norman castellated form of building.</p>

<p>[A] GREAT BARR is an agreeable village, which has long been the property
of the Scott family, who have here one of the finest mansions in the
county. This seat stands in a beautiful valley, affording the most delightful
prospects of hill and dale, varied by wood and water. Shady walks
and rustic seats furnish the most attractive conveniences for the promenade.
One object in particular fixes the attention; it is an urn near the
flower garden, to the memory of Miss Mary Dolman, the cousin of Shenstone,
whose elegant pen supplied a beautiful tribute in Latin. The
summit of Barr Beacon, which is 653 feet in height, was the spot from


<span class="sidenote">Barr Beacon,
653 feet
high.</span>


whence the Druids gave notice, by watch-fires, of their periodical sacrifices;
and it was used both by the Saxons and the Danes, as a beacon to alarm
the country in times of danger. The chapel of the village is of remarkable
beauty; its eastern window contains a painting on glass by Mr. Eginton,
who has improved upon the design of the Rev. Mr. Peter's "Spirit of a
Child."</p>



<p>[B] GREAT BARRINGTON is a parish containing about 1000 acres,
including some portion of Oxfordshire within its limits, as well as a small
tract belonging to Berkshire. Previous to the conquest, the manor was
held by Earl Harold; the present owner is Lord Dynevor, Lord Lieut.
and Cust. Rot. of Carmarthen. Barrington church appears to have
been erected about the time of Henry VII. Beneath one of the windows
of the aisle are the monument and effigies of Captain Edward Bray,


<span class="sidenote">Capt. Edward
Bray.</span>


grandfather of Sir Giles Bray, lord of the manor, who is represented
in armour, with a ruff round his neck and a sword girt on the
"right" side. This peculiarity originated from the captain having killed
a man at Tilbury camp; and, in token of his sorrow, he determined never
more to use his right hand. Lord Chancellor Talbot was buried in this
church; he was the son of William Talbot, Bishop of Durham, and was
born in the year 1684. After being elected a fellow of All Soul's College,
Oxford, he married, and consequently was compelled to give up his fellowship.
When he left the university, he was admitted a member of the
society of Lincoln's Inn, and was speedily called to the bar. He was
chosen to represent the now disfranchised borough of Tregony, in Cornwall,
and afterwards was made member for the city of Durham. He died
in the enjoyment of the highest character, after a short illness, on the 14th
of February, 1737. Few Chancellors have been more lamented, both in
public and private life. Lord Talbot acquired universal esteem. The
Hall was built by him in the year 1734, soon after which it was destroyed
by fire. The grounds furnish a good specimen of the "ferme ornee,"
(ornamental farm) and the park, about three miles in circumference, is
well planted with a variety of beautiful trees.</p>

<p>[A] BARROW. This large and pleasant village appears to have taken its
name from an ancient tumulus. It is occupied principally by gentlemen
farmers, many of whom, however, derive great profit from the quantities
of lime which they get up and burn. This village having been for many


<span class="sidenote">Superior
lime quarries.</span>


centuries celebrated for a hard blue stone, similar to that in the vale of
Belvoir, and when calcined, produces a very fine matter, from which
is prepared a particularly hard, firm, and greatly esteemed cement. Various
fossil remains are found amongst the limestone. One of the petrifactions,
still preserved at Cambridge, with Dr. Woodward's fossils, is
a plain and bold representation of a flat-fish, about twelve inches long.
Mr. Jones, in his "Philosophical Disquisitions," notices it by saying,
that "our country hath lately afforded what I apprehend to be the greatest
curiosity of the sort that ever appeared. It is the entire figure of a bream,
more than a foot in length, and of a proportionable depth, with the scales,
fins, and gills, fairly projecting from the surface, like a sculpture in
relievo, and with all the lineaments, even to the most minute fibres of the
tail, so complete, that the like was never seen before." Dr. William Beveridge,
one of the most learned prelates of the English church, was born
here in the year 1638. At St. John's College, Cambridge, he applied


<span class="sidenote">The pious
Beveridge
born here.</span>


himself with intense application to the study of oriental literature. He
reviewed the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, and Samaritan tongues,
and produced a Syriac grammar. He was raised to the see of St. Asaph,
in the year 1704, but he enjoyed his new dignity for a short period,&mdash;his
death took place in the year 1708. In his divinity he was Calvinistic;
from the simplicity and piety of his character, he was beloved by all
parties. He lies buried in St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>



<p>[B] BARRY ISLAND, the name of which has been thought to have
been derived from St. Baroche, a hermit, who, according to Cressy, died
here in the year 700. This island, which lets for about &pound;80. a year, is
estimated to contain about 300 acres. In Leland's time there was, in
the middle of it, a "fair little chapel used," but there was no dwelling.
Since that period, however, a house has been erected for the residence of a
farmer, which, in the summer, is converted into a boarding-house, for the
reception of sea-bathers. The family of Giraldus de Barri, are said to


<span class="sidenote">Remarkable
noises heard
here.</span>


have taken their title from this island, of which they were once lords.
"It is remarkable," observes Giraldus, "that in a rock near the entrance
of the island, there is a small cavity, to which, if the ear is applied, a noise
is heard like that of smiths at work&mdash;the blowing of bellows, strokes of
hammers, grinding of tools, and roaring of furnaces; and it might easily
have been imagined, that such noises which are continued at the ebb and
flow of the tides, were occasioned by the influx of the sea under the
cavities of the rocks." Sir Richard Hoare, in his additions to Giraldus,
observes as follows:&mdash;"Towards the southern part of the island, on a
spot called Nell's Point, is a fine well, to which great numbers of women
resort on Holy Thursday, and, having washed their eyes at the spring,
each drops a pin into it. The landlord of the boarding-house told me,


<span class="sidenote">Curious
custom.</span>


that on clearing out the well he took out a pint full of these votive offerings."
On the main land, opposite the western extremity of the island,
lies the village of Barry, near which are some remains of the castle. A
few miles north-westward from Barry are the remains of Penmark castle,
anciently the property of Sir Gilbert Humphreville, one of the followers
of Fitzhamon. Llancarvan, in this vicinity, was once the seat of a religious
house, said to have been founded by Cadoc the Wise, in the 6th
century. Llancarvan is also distinguished as the birth-place of Caradoc,
the Welsh annalist, who compiled a history of the Principality, from the
abdication of Cadwaladyr, 686, to his own time. Tref Walter, or
Walterston, in this parish, was the residence of Walter de Mapes, a
writer of some note towards the middle of the 12th century. He was
Archdeacon of Oxford, and Chaplain to Henry I. He built the church
of Llancarvan, a large substantial edifice, and the village of Walterston,
with a mansion for himself. His literary labours comprise a translation
of the British Chronicle into Latin, and a Welsh version of Geoffrey of
Monmouth's fabulous paraphrase of the same work. He wrote also a
Treatise on Agriculture in the Welsh language.</p>

<p>[A] BARTHOMLEY contains several townships. The nave of the church
has a richly carved wooden roof, dated 1589. On the 22d of December,
1643, a troop of Lord Byron's passing through the village, made an
attack upon this venerable edifice, into which several of the inhabitants
had gone for safety; they soon got possession of it, and having set fire to
the forms, rushes, and mats, made such a smoke that the men who had
retreated into the steeple were obliged to call for quarter, but their assailants
having got them into their power, are said to have stripped them
all, and most cruelly murdered twelve of them in cold blood, three only


<span class="sidenote">Cruel murder.</span>


being suffered to escape. A free school was founded here, in the year
1676, by the Rev. Mr. Steele, in which ten children are educated. In
the year 1787, Mrs. Mary, Mrs. Margaret, and Mrs. Judith Alsager, ladies
of the manor, obtained an Act of Parliament to enable them to finish a new
church, or chapel, to be called Christ's Church, or Chapel, in that township.
The same ladies built a school-house, and founded a school there,
for the education of children of both sexes.</p>

<p>[B] BARTLOW. Near this place, are four contiguous barrows, known by
the name of Bartlow Hills, from their situation with respect to Bartlow
Church. These are vulgarly, though erroneously, regarded as the tumuli
raised over the slain in the battle fought between Edmund Ironside and
the Danish King, Canute, in the year 1016. It is evident, indeed, from
our account of Ashington, at page 50, that the place of action should be
sought for, rather in the vicinity of the sea than at the northern extremity
of the county. Camden states, that these stone coffins, with broken human
bones in them, were found in one of these barrows; and Hollingshead
affirms, that two bodies were found in one stone coffin. Mr. Gough remarks,
that we do not find the use of stone coffins amongst the northern
nations in their Pagan state; and the Danes were not converted until long
after the time of Canute. The origin of these barrows, therefore, cannot
now be traced.</p>

<p>[A] BARTON. Stockbridge Hall, an ancient edifice, was the seat of the
Lancasters, whose arms are yet seen on the ceiling of the dining-room, and
who continued here through twelve generations, when their estates fell to
the Lowthers. The church, which is a low and extensive building, with a
heavy tower between the chancel and the nave, contains the tomb of one


<span class="sidenote">Remarkable
epitaph.</span>


of the Lancasters; some escutcheons of several families in the neighbourhood,
and a brass plate, on which is this remarkable epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Under this stone, reader, interred doth lie,<br />
Beauty and virtue's true epitomy.<br />
At her appearance the noone sun<br />
Blushed and shrunk in, 'cause quite undone.<br />
In her concentered did all graces dwell;<br />
God plucked my rose that he might take a smell.<br />
I'll say no more, but weeping, wish I may,<br />
Soone with thy dear chaste ashes come to lay."<br />
</p>

<p>The lady thus extravagantly eulogised, was Frances, the wife of Launcelot
Dawes; she died in 1673. Barton school was founded in 1641, by four
priests, natives of this parish.</p>



<p>[B] BARTON. Near this village is a large stone, called Four-shire stone,
from its forming the point of junction of the four counties of Gloucester,
Worcester, Warwick, and Oxford. Here once resided an attorney of so
pacific a disposition that he usually acted as mediator when disputes arose.
This anomalous person, named Dover, instituted the annual festivities
termed Cotswold Games, and was for forty years their chief supporter.


<span class="sidenote">Cotswold
games.</span>


These diversions were celebrated upon the Cotswold Hills, in Gloucestershire,
and prodigious multitudes are said to have resorted to them. They
consisted of wrestling, cudgel-playing, leaping, pitching the bar, throwing
the sledge, tossing the pike, with various other feats of strength and activity.
A castle of boards was erected on this occasion, from which guns
were frequently discharged. Dover received permission from James I. to
hold these sports, and he appeared at their celebration in the very clothes
which that monarch had formerly worn; but it is said there was much
more dignity in his form and aspect. John Heywood, the epigramatist,
speaking of these games, says&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"He fometh like a bore, the beaste should seem bold,<br />
For he is as fierce as a lyon of Cotsolde."<br />

<p>[A] BARTON. This ancient town is pleasantly situated about three-quarters
of a mile from the southern bank of the Humber. It was formerly
surrounded by a rampart and fossee, the remains of which are still discernable.
It was doubtless a place of great strength before the conquest,
and served as a barrier against the irruptions of the Saxons and Danes.
At the period of the conquest it was a principal port of the Humber, and


<span class="sidenote">Once a
place of
importance.</span>


until the rise of Kingston-upon-Hull it enjoyed an extensive commerce.
At present its derives its principal consequence from being the point
whence the communication with the Lincoln road is continued across the
Humber to Hull, a distance of about six miles and a half.</p>

<p>[B] STEEPLE BARTON. In this parish is situated Rowsham, which
was, for several centuries, the seat of the Dormers, and it continued in
their possession until the decease of General Dormer, in the year 1750.
That gentleman bequeathed the mansion and estates to his cousin, Sir


<span class="sidenote">Rowsham
House.</span>


Clement Cottrell, Knight, Master of the Ceremonies to George II., who
annexed the name of Dormer to his own, and in whose family the property
has since remained. The situation is extremely fine, and the grounds,
which were laid out by Kent, during the life-time of General Dormer,
afford a variety of picturesque and pleasant views. The mansion was
built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but a few alterations were made at
subsequent periods. The walls are embattled, and the doors are singularly
enough perforated with holes (with slides to cover) so as to admit
muskets being pointed through them. There is a large hall, and valuable
library, containing many old and rare authors. A very excellent collection of
paintings, (about 180 in number), and of busts and other figures in bronze,
(amounting to fifty-five), has also been formed here. Horace Walpole,
in one of his eloquent letters to George Montague, has thus spoken of
this place:&mdash;"But the greatest pleasure we had, was in seeing Sir Charles
Cotterell's, at Rowsham: it reinstated Kent with me; he has no where
shewn so much taste. The house is old, and was bad; he has improved
it&mdash;stuck as close as he could to gothic; has made a delightful library,
and the whole is comfortable. The garden is Daphne in little, the sweetest
little groves, streams, glades, porticoes, cascades, and rivers imaginable:
all the scenes are perfectly classic. Well, if I had such a house, such a
library, so pretty a place, and so pretty a wife, I think I should let King
George send to Herenhausen for a Master of the Ceremonies." The pleasure-grounds
are beautifully shaded by flourishing and noble beech trees;
they are also ornamented by several stone statues, which all throw up
water, except a very fine one of the dying gladiator, and a group of the
lion tearing the horse, by Sheemacher.</p>

<p>[A] BASFORD lies in a bottom, approached from the race-ground. The
scenery around it is rich in the extreme. This village has greatly increased


<span class="sidenote">The trade.</span>


of late, from various manufactures, and the improvements consequent
upon them. Here are corn and cotton-mills, and the bleaching
and dying branches of business are carried on with considerable success.
The church has a very handsome spire, with a nave and side aisles in very
good order, but there are no ancient inscriptions. The importance of this
place has also been kept up, by its being the seat of the Court of the Honour
of Peverel, since it was removed from Nottingham. It sits twice in the
year, to try causes as high as &pound;50. A jail for the court is situated here,
which Howard describes as having, at the time of his writing, merely one
room, with three beds; but the keepers told him he had another little
room for women prisoners, of whom there being none in his custody, he
applied the apartment to domestic uses. A bowling-green, close by the
jail, is much frequented by the inhabitants of Nottingham. At Mapperley,
a hamlet in this parish, is a handsome seat of Ichabod Wright, Esq., a
banker of Nottingham.</p>


<p>[B] BASFORD. Here was born, in 1630, the celebrated Charles Cotton,
a burlesque poet of the seventeenth century. He received his education


<span class="sidenote">Charles
Cotton.</span>


at Cambridge, and afterwards travelled through France. On his return
to England he resided with his father at Basford, in the neighbourhood of
the Peak. His first production was, a poetical essay on the gallant Earl
of Derby. In 1656, he married a daughter of Sir Thomas Hutchinson, a
Nottinghamshire Knight. Two years after this his father died; he then
succeeded him in the family estate, which was encumbered with mortgages:
being of an improvident disposition, he was subject to constant
embarrassments, and was even confined for some months in a prison for
debt. After the death of his first wife, he married the Countess Dowager of
Ardglass. He died at Westminster in 1687. Some of his poems, of considerable
merit, were published after his death.</p>



<p>[C] BASING, or OLD BASING, though a small village, is of some importance,
as the scene of a desperate and bloody battle between the Danes and
the Saxons, in 871, commanded by King Ethelred and his brother Alfred,
when the latter were defeated. It was, however, rendered more famous
by the gallant stand made against the parliamentary forces in the reign of
Charles I., by John Poulet, Marquis of Winchester, a lineal descendant


<span class="sidenote">Great battles
fought
here.</span>


of Hugh de Port, who, at the time of the Domesday Survey, held 55 lordships
in this county. This small village was the principal of these extensive
possessions, and appears to have been the very site of a castle, as
mention of the land of the old castle of Basing is made in a grant allowed
by John de Port, to the neighbouring priory at Monks Sherborne, in the
reign of Henry II. His grandson, William, assumed the surname of
St. John; and Robert, Lord St. John, in the 43d of Henry III., obtained
a license to fix a pole upon the bann of his moat, at Basing, with permission
to continue it so fortified during the pleasure of the King. In the
reign of Richard II., Basing was transferred by marriage to the Poynings;
and again, in the time of Henry VI., to the Paulets, by the alliance of
Constance with Sir John Paulet, of Nunny Castle, in Somersetshire. Sir
William Paulet, Knt., third in descent from this couple, created Baron
St. John, of Basing, by Henry VIII.; and Earl of Wiltshire, and Marquis
of Winchester, by Edward VI., was a very accomplished and polite
nobleman, greatly in favour at court during most of the successive changes
that occurred in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary,
and Queen Elizabeth. He held the office of treasurer nearly 30 years,
sustaining himself by the courtly maxim, of "being a willow, and not an
oak." He rebuilt Basing Castle, in a magnificent, and even in a princely
style; indeed, so much so, that Camden, in allusion to the immense expense
of living entailed on his family by its splendour, observes that, "it
was so overpowered by its own weight, that his posterity has been forced
to pull down a part of it." Here, in 1560, he entertained Queen Elizabeth
with "all good cheer," and so much to her satisfaction, that she playfully


<span class="sidenote">Queen
Elizabeth
splendidly
entertained
here for 13
days.</span>


lamented his great age; "for by my troth," said she, "if my Lord
Treasurer were but a young man, I could find it in my heart to have him
for a husband before any man in England." William, the great-grandson
of this nobleman, and fourth Marquis of Winchester, had also, in 1601,
the honour of having Queen Elizabeth for a guest for "thirteen days, to
the great charge of the sayde Lorde Marquesse." During her residence
here, the Duke of Biron, accompanied by about 20 of the French nobility,
and a retinue of about 400 persons, were accommodated at the Vine, the
seat of Lord Sandys, which had been purposely furnished with hangings
and plate from the Tower, and Hampton Court, and with seven score beds
and furniture, "which the willing and obedient people of the countrie of
Southampton, upon two days' warning, had brought in thither to lend
the Queen." When Elizabeth departed from Basing, she affirmed,
that "she had done that in Hampshire, that none of her ancestors ever
did; neither that any Prince in Christendom could do: that was, she
had in her progresses, in her subject's houses, entertained a royal ambassador,
and had royally entertained him." John, son of the preceding,
and fifth Marquis of Winchester, was the brave nobleman who rendered
his name immortal by his gallant defence of Basing House, in the cause of
Charles I., during a tedious succession of sieges and blockades, which,
with short intermissions, continued upwards of two years. The journal
of the siege, printed in Oxford, in 1645, is one of the most eventful pieces
of history during the civil war. The final investment appears to have been
undertaken by Cromwell, who took it by storm, in October 1645, and
burnt it to the ground, in despite of the Aimez Loyaulte, which the Marquis


<span class="sidenote">Burnt by
Cromwell.</span>


had written with a diamond in every window, and which has ever
since been the motto of the family arms. The plunder obtained on this
occasion is said to have amounted to &pound;200,000. in cash, jewels, and rich
furniture. The number of soldiers slain before the walls from the commencement
of the siege, is recorded to have been upwards of 2,000. There
is a traditionary report, that the garrison was partly surprized through
some of the troops being engaged at cards when the assault commenced.
From a survey made in 1798, it appears that the area of the works, including
the garden and entrenchments, occupied about fourteen acres and
a half. The form was extremely irregular, the ditches very deep, and the
ramparts high and strong; some of the remains are yet very bold and
striking. The site of the ruins is particularly commanding. The canal
from Basingstoke has been cut through a part of the works, and the outward
entrenchments have been rendered very obscure and imperfect from
recent improvements in the grounds. The brave Marquis, whose property
was reduced to ruin in the cause of his Sovereign, lived to the restoration,
but received no recompence for his immense losses. He died in 1674, and
was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, who, when he saw that other
men of sense were at their wits' end, in the arbitary and tyrannical reign
of James II., thought it prudent to assume the character of a madman, as
the first Brutus did, in the reign of Tarquin. He danced, hunted, or
hawked, a part of the day, went to bed before noon, and constantly
sat at table all night. He went to dinner at six or seven in the evening,
and his meal lasted till six or seven in the morning; during which time
he ate, drank, smoked, talked, or listened to music. The company that


<span class="sidenote">The sixth
Marquis of
Winchester,
a singular
character.</span>


dined with him were at liberty to rise and amuse themselves, or to take a
nap, whenever they were so disposed; but the dishes and bottles were all
the while standing upon the table. Such a man as this was thought a
very unlikely person to concern himself with politics, or with religion. By
this conduct, he was neither embroiled in public affairs, nor gave the least
umbrage to the court; but he exerted himself so much in the revolution,
that he was, for his eminent services, created Duke of Bolton: he afterwards
raised a regiment of foot for the reduction of Ireland. Charles, son
of the former, and second Duke of Bolton, assisted in the great work of the
revolution; and was one of the noblemen appointed at Exeter, in November,
1688, to manage the revenues of the Prince of Orange, as Sovereign
of England. In 1717, he was declared Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.
Charles, the eldest son, and third Duke of Bolton, filled several high
offices in the state. This nobleman, on the death of his first wife, from
whom he had long been separated, wedded the celebrated Lavinia Beswick,
or Fenton, more known by the name of Polly Peachem, from her celebrity


<span class="sidenote">Polly
Peachem.</span>


in the performance of that character in the "Beggar's Opera." The parish
church of Basing is a large, ancient, and curious structure, standing at a
short distance from the site of Basing House, with a tower rising in the
centre. In a niche at the west-end is a figure of the Virgin Mary: the
roof is supported by round arches, springing from massive columns. This
edifice was repaired in 1510, by Sir John Paulet, who, with his father,
John Paulet, Esq., and their respective wives, lie buried beneath two
arched tombs, one on each side the chancel. Beneath the south aisle is
the family vault of the Paulets, in which six Dukes of Bolton, with many
of their noble relations, are deposited. A mural monument has also been
erected in this church to the memory of Francis Russel, Esq., F.R.S. and
F.S.A., a native of Basingstoke, who assisted Mr. Nichols in his History
of Leicestershire. He died in 1795.</p>

<p>[A] BASINGSTOKE. This large, ancient, and populous town is situated
in a pleasant and well-wooded part of the county, and commands a considerable
trade from its standing at the junction of five great roads.
In the "Domesday Book" it is mentioned as always having been a royal


<span class="sidenote">Royal
manor.</span>


manor, and as never having paid any tax, nor been distributed into hides: it
is also noticed in that survey as having a market, whose tolls were worth
"thirty shillings": we presume this to have been the weekly collection&mdash;a
large sum in those days. From this town a canal was made to the river
Wey, in Surrey; it was commenced in 1778. Its length is thirty-seven
miles and a quarter, and the expense of cutting it amounted to &pound;100,000.
A large portion of this sum was laid out in forming a tunnel, nearly three
quarters of a mile in length, through a hill near Odiham. Besides corn and
flour, coals, timber, manure, and goods of almost every description are conveyed
to different parts of the country by this channel. The first barge
arrived at Basingstoke Wharf in January, 1794. Among the numerous
projected advantages which led to the formation of the canal, was, the presumed
cultivation of Bagshot Heath, and other heaths within the line of its
course. A beautiful ruin overlooks the town on the north side, called
Holy Ghost chapel. This was founded by Sir William, afterwards Lord
Sandys, who with Bishop Fox, obtained a licence from Henry VIII. to
found a brotherhood, to continue in perpetual succession, for the maintenance
of a priest to perform divine service, and for the instruction of youth
in literature. On an eminence in the vicinity, is an ancient encampment
of an elliptical form, supposed to be British, three thousand three hundred


<span class="sidenote">Aubrey
Camp.</span>


feet in circumference; it is called "Aubrey Camp," or familiarly "Bury
Bank;" the ditch on the outside is partly filled up by the labours of the
agriculturist; and in Rook's Down, in this neighbourhood, while cutting a
new road in 1831, a number of human skeletons were discovered, supposed
to be of those who fell in some battle fought near this place. The
free grammar school adjoins the venerable ruins of the chapel of the Holy
Ghost; it is an ancient edifice, and is supposed originally to have been the
parish church. This grammar school was first founded by Sir William
Sandys, in connexion with the "Guild of the Holy Ghost," and was
re-established upon the dissolution of that fraternity, by Queen Mary, in
the succeeding reign. There are twelve boys at present on the foundation.
Drs. Jos. Warton, the refined poet and critic, and his brother Thomas
Warton, Poet Laureate, were both educated here, under their father, Thomas
Warton, B.D., Professor of Poetry in the university of Oxford, a writer of
considerable ability. John De Basinge, a learned Greek scholar, a friend
and contemporary of that intelligent historian, Matthew Paris, was a
native of this town. He was a man eminent for piety and learning, and
a perfect master of the Greek and Latin languages&mdash;an eloquent orator&mdash;an
able mathematician, and a sound divine. Having laid the foundation of
his university learning at Oxford, he went to Paris, and from thence to
Athens; upon his return to England, he brought over several curious
Greek manuscripts, and introduced the use of Greek numerical figures


<span class="sidenote">Eminent
men born<br />
here.</span>


into this country; and to facilitate the knowledge of that rich language,
which at that remote period was very little known or appreciated in the
western world. He translated from the Greek, into the Latin, the celebrated
Grammar, entitled "The Denatus of the Greeks," and the learning
and piety of this truly good man, recommended him to the esteem of
all the lovers of literature of that time: particularly that of Robert Grosteste,
Bishop of Lincoln, by whom he was promoted from the Archdeaconry
of London, to that of Leicester; he died in 1252. Among other
subjects he wrote a Latin translation of the harmony of the four Gospels;
and it was this learned individual that informed Robert, Bishop of Lincoln,
that he had seen at Athens, a book called "The Testament of the
Twelve Patriarchs," upon which the Bishop sent for it and translated it
into Latin; this valuable MS. was first printed in 1555, and has often
been reprinted in English. At Basingstoke, was also born Sir James
Lancaster, an eminent navigator, who in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
explored the Arctic Sea. Thomas Warton, the historian of English
Poetry, was descended from an ancient and honorable family in Beverly,
County York, and born at Basingstoke, in 1728; from his infancy he
discovered a vein for poetry, and at the age of nine years he wrote to
his sister that remarkable production of his genius: viz. a translation
from the Latin of Martial:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"When bold Leander sought his distant fair,<br />
(Nor could the sea a braver burthen bear)<br />
Thus to the swelling waves he spake his woe,<br />
Drown me on my return&mdash;but spare me as I go."<br />
</p>

<p>This curious document bears date from the school of Basingstoke, Nov.
1737. In March 1773, at the age of sixteen, he was admitted a Commoner
at Trinity College, Oxford, and soon after elected a Scholar. At
this college Mr. Warton continued, with trifling intervals, forty-seven
years. In 1745, he published "The Pleasures of Melancholy." In 1749,
in consequence of a foolish riot occasioned by some of the scholars, Mason,
the Poet, produced a poem called the "Isis," reflecting upon the loyalty
of the college, upon which Mr. Warton immediately wrote the "Triumph
of Isis," a poem of some merit, and a severe commentary upon the other
production. About this time, his talents being generally acknowledged,
he became Poet Laureate, and in 1750 he took a Master's Degree, and in
1751 succeeded to a Fellowship. In 1754 he published his observations
on the "Faerie Queene of Spencer." In 1757, upon the resignation of
Mr Hawkins, of Pembroke College, he was elected Professor of Poetry,
which he held according to the usual custom for ten years. He died,
May 21, 1790. Basingstoke is one of the polling places for the northern
division of the county.</p>

<p>[A] BASINGWERK. This place is chiefly celebrated for the remains of
its ancient abbey; for the vestiges of a house belonging to the Knights
Templars; and for a castle, once the key to this part of the country. The
abbey, which had the names also of Maes-Glas and Greenfield monastery,


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
Abbey.</span>


is beautifully situated in a meadow between two hills, on the eastern side
of the mouth of the Holywell river. It was founded, according to Tanner,
in 1131, by Ranulph, Earl of Chester; others say in 1150, by Henry II.
The abbot was frequently summoned to attend in parliament by Edward I.
and at the dissolution of monasteries, the annual revenue amounted to
&pound;150 7s. 3d. The remains convey an imperfect idea of the original
architecture. The doors and lower arches were semi-circular and unornamented,
the windows were long, narrow, and pointed; but the south
wall of the transept, one doorway, and one pointed arch, are all that
remain of the church, and the offices have entirely disappeared. At a short
distance from the ruins is an oak of great age, called the Abbot's Oak,
which measures fifteen feet two inches in circumference. But the oaks
and elms in this neighbourhood, though of a large size, appear withered
and blasted by the effect of the channel breezes; the sycamores and
maples are the only trees that flourish; a useful hint to planters. The house
for the lay order of the Knights Templars, was instituted by Henry II.,
for the purpose of defence against the inroads of the Welsh, and of this
no more than some portion of the offices remain. Vestiges of the castle


<span class="sidenote">Mostyn
Hall.</span>


are yet visible in the fragments and foundation of a wall at some distance
from the abbey, on the very margin of Watts-dyke. On a slope among
hanging woods, near the township of Bagilt, stands Bagilt hall, a substantial
mansion of ancient erection, late the seat of Paul Panton, Esq.
Mostyn hall, a seat of Sir Thomas Mostyn, exhibits a variety of interesting
features. Approached by a venerable avenue and a magnificent gateway,
it stands in a small but beautiful park; it consisted originally of a
square tower and two halls, in the larger of which the festive orgies of
the baronial board were performed; but large additions were made in
1631, and many of its pristine features are defaced. Numerous paintings
decorate the rooms, consisting for the most part of portraits, which illustrate
all the varieties of costume in the several ages of their production;
among the treasures of art are also many unique statues, busts, bronzes,
and other articles of ancient or foreign production. In this neighbourhood
are numerous collieries, the different appearance of which are phenomena
interesting to the geologist. On the summit of a height called
Mostyn mountain, is a monumental stone denominated Maen Achwynfan
(the stone of lamentation). Its form is that of an obelisk; in height
twelve feet, and two feet-four in thickness. It is probably a memorial of
the dead slain in battle; but there appear to be no certain grounds for
determining the period of its formation.</p>

<p>[A] BASSALEG, a beautiful picturesque little village. In this parish
was a Priory of black monks of the Benedictine order, founded by Robert
de Haye, and Gundreda, his wife, between the years 1101 and 1120. No
remains of this building exist but a ruin in a wood, about one mile distant
from the church, called Coed-y-monachty, which is supposed to have
been part of the structure. At about one mile distant, near the road to
Llanfihangel, is a circular encampment, called Careg-y-saesson, but
almost obscured by underwood. Its name has induced some to attribute
it to the Saxons, but saesson is a term of reproach, which the Welsh
bestow on all foreigners. The entrenchment is a single foss and rampart
of earth. About one mile distant is another of a singular shape, with loose
stones lying in the foss, probably the remains of walls. These fortresses
are apparently British, and a meadow near Machen Place, called Maes
Arthur, records the memory of that celebrated hero. From Bassaleg to the
vale of Machen, the country is undulating and fertile. This vale is pleasingly


<span class="sidenote">Machen
place.</span>


sequestered, yet intermixed with wildness and cultivation. The hills
which skirt it are partly covered with herbage, and partly overhung with
thick forests. The Rumney continues the boundary of the two counties
of Monmouth and Glamorgan. This river, with the church, and Machen
hill, almost covered with lime-kilns, give variety and cheerfulness to the
scenery. Machen Place lies at the commencement of the vale, under the
hanging groves of Rupara. A circular apartment called the hunting-room
is decorated with a rich stuccoed ceiling, representing Diana in the middle,
surrounded with seats, churches, and parties, in twelve compartments.</p>



<p>[B] BATH. This ancient and far-famed city is the chief ornament of the
west of England; that it is indebted to its medicinal springs for its origin
as well as importance, there can be little doubt, but the period of its
foundation is altogether unknown. The discovery of its springs, or rather,
of their virtues, was for a long time ascribed to King Bladud, traditionally
recorded "as the son of Lud Hudibras, King of Britain, about 2,500 years
ago. In his youth he became infected with the leprosy, and, at the
petition of the courtiers, who feared the contagion, was banished by his
father from the palace. The Queen, on his departure, gave him a ring,
as a token by which he should make himself known to her if ever he recovered.
The young prince, when he reached Keynsham, met with a
swineherd, by whom he was retained as an assistant. In a short time,


<span class="sidenote">King Bladud.</span>


he perceived that he had tainted the pigs with his leprosy. To conceal
this misfortune, he sought permission to drive the herd to the opposite
side of the Avon, under pretext that the acorns there were finer, and more
abundant. Passing the river at a ford, since denominated Swineford, he
led his herd to the hills on the north-side of Bath. While he was addressing
his prayers to the rising sun, the pigs, impelled by a sudden
phrenzy, ran up the valley to the spot where the hot-springs, boiling up,



<span class="sidenote">The discovery
of the
Baths.</span>


mixed their waters with the decayed weeds and foliage, and formed a bog.
In this warm oozy-bed they began to roll, and wallow with delight;
nor could their keeper allure them away, until extreme hunger pressed them
to follow him. On washing them, he perceived that some had shed their
white scurf; and he had not been many days longer in these parts, here he
perceived that one of his best sows, which had been long wandering in the
mire about the waters, was perfectly cured. Bladud, judging that the remedy
which had succeeded in a particular instance, would prove generally
efficacious, stripped himself naked, alternately rolled in the mud, and
washed in the waters; and, after a few repetitions of this discipline, came
out perfectly sound. Elated by this good fortune, he drove home his


<span class="sidenote">Bladud and
his pigs.</span>

pigs, returned to court, and, shewing his ring, was recognized with rapture,
and restored to his former rank and dignity. His father afterwards
determined on sending him to Athens, to improve his natural genius. A
splendid retinue was ordered to attend him; but Bladud preferred to travel
as a private person, considering the parade of grandeur as an impediment
to the acquisition of knowledge. After devoting eleven years to
the study of literature, mathematics, and necromancy, he returned to
Britain, was appointed Regent during his father's old age, and succeeded
to the throne after his death. One of his first public works was the erection
of a city near the springs, which thenceforward became the capital of
the British monarchs. In his old age he devoted himself to the formation
of visionary projects; the most daring of which was the construction of a
pair of wings to fly with. In one of his attempts he fell and broke his
neck, much to the grief of his subjects, who had enjoyed the blessings of
his wise government more than twenty years." This account of the origin
of Bath was long popular; but the inquiries of the present day have proved
it unworthy of credit, and have adduced reasons to conclude that the city
was founded by the Romans, about the middle of the first century. The


<span class="sidenote">The Roman
city.</span>


form of the city approached to a parallelogram, extending on one side so
as to form an outline somewhat pentagonal, and stretching in length, from
east to west, about 1200 feet, and in the broadest parts, from north to
south, 1140 feet. The wall, which enclosed this space, appears, from
subsequent discoveries, to have been twenty feet above ground in height,
and in thickness sixteen feet at the base, and eight at the summit,
strengthened with five towers, rising at the angles, and having four port&aelig;,
or entrances, facing the cardinal points, which were connected by two
grand streets, dividing the city into four parts, and intersecting each other
at the centre. Near the point of intersection were the springs, which the
Romans converted into magnificent baths, by attaching to them suitable
edifices, which, when complete, extended to two hundred and forty feet
from east to west, and one hundred and twenty from north to south. The
Roman appellation of the city, expressive of the genial heat and vigour
derived from the springs, was Aqu&aelig; Solis, the waters of the sun. Roads
were soon constructed to communicate with the neighbouring posts and
encampments, and "a little Rome began to adorn a dreary and inhospitable
wild." Agricola passed a winter here, after his successful campaign in
Wales; and Arian erected here a "fabrica," or college of armourers.
About the year 208, Geta, the younger son of Septimius Severus, resided
in Bath, while his father was in Caledonia, quelling an insurrection.
Some complimentary statues were raised on this and other occasions.
The most eminent of the Roman structures was the temple of Minerva, on


<span class="sidenote">Their temples
and baths.</span>


the eastern side of the great fosse-way, and nearly mid-way between the
Porta Decumana, and the Porta Flumentana. Its western front consisted
of a portico, supported by large fluted columns, of the Corinthian order.
Behind this temple, towards the east, stood the splendid baths, the foundations
of which were discovered in 1755, at the depth of twenty feet
beneath the surface. Of the remains of Roman grandeur discovered from
time to time, various specimens are preserved, and deposited, by order of
the corporation, in a small building erected for the purpose, at the end of
Bath-street. In the year 493, a large army of Saxons, under the command
of &AElig;lla, and his three sons, Cymenus, Pleting, and Cissa,
encamped on Lansdown, and laid siege to Bath. At this period the heroic
Arthur was performing wonders in favour of his countrymen. Apprized
of the operations of the Saxon general, he hastened after him, attacked,
and defeated him in a bloody and obstinate battle. About twenty-seven
years afterwards, he again delivered Bath from the assaults of these ferocious
invaders, by defeating a powerful army, on which occasion he is
said to have slain four hundred and forty men with his own hand. John
de Villula, a native of Tours, purchased the demesne of Rufus, in 1090, for
five hundred marks, and obtained permission to remove the Pontifical
seat from Wells thither; he rebuilt the monastery and church, restored the
public and private edifices, and thus became the founder of a new city, on
the ruins of the old one. Henry I. confirmed and extended the privileges


<span class="sidenote">The monastery.</span>


which his predecessor had granted, by adding the hidage of the city; and,
in 1106, Villula, then Bishop of Bath, conferred the whole on the monastery
of St. Peter. Henry paid a visit to Bath in the Easter of 1107.
The city remained in the possession of the bishops until 1193, when
Savaric gave it to Richard I., in exchange for the rich Abbey of Glastonbury.
The prior, however, continued to hold the city under an annual
rent of thirty pounds, exclusive of the levies which were made by the king
on extraordinary emergencies. One of these occurred in the forty-seventh
year of Edward III., to the amount of &pound;13. 6s. 8d., a sum which conveys
the idea of the inferiority of Bath, in point of population, to Bristol,
which paid seven times as much. Four years after that period, the number
of lay inhabitants in the city, above the age of fourteen, amounted to
570, and that of the clerics, in the archdeaconry, to 201. In this and
succeeding reigns the property of the monastery was greatly augmented;
and the monks of Bath are said to have cultivated the manufacture of
cloth to such an extent as to render it one of the principal cities in the west
of England for that branch of trade. This city sent Members to Parliament


<span class="sidenote">Monks were
clothiers.</span>


as early as 1297. Queen Elizabeth, in 1590, granted a charter, which declared
Bath to be a city of itself, and constituted a certain number of the
citizens as a corporation, by "the name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Citizens of the City of Bath." In the reign of James II. the corporation
shut the gates against the Duke of Monmouth, when he summoned them,
and apprehended the few adherents to his cause that remained within
their walls. Six of these unfortunate persons afterwards fell victims to
the vindictive cruelty of Jefferies. The Jacobite principles prevailed at
Bath long after the revolution; and Carte, the historian, is said to have
headed a party in favour of the pretender, during the rebellion of 1715.
Being discovered, he leaped out of a window in his canonicals, and fled.
The city is nearly surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills of considerable
height. This range of hills opens to allow a course for the Avon, which
winds around it, receiving numerous articles of merchandize, from hence
conveyed in barges to Bristol. Bath is divided into four parishes: St. Peter
and St. Paul, St. James, St. Michael, and Walcot, exclusive of the out
parishes of Bath-Hampton, Bath-Wick, Bath-Ford, and Bath-Easton.


<span class="sidenote">Cathedral
and other
churches.</span>


The parish of St. Peter and St. Paul occupies the centre of the city, and
formerly contained two churches, the abbey church, and the church of St.
Mary of Stall, which stood on the spot of ground now occupied by the
houses connected with the Pump-room Piazza. The Abbey church of
Bath is of that class of architecture commonly denominated the Florid
Gothic. It remains in the same form as when finished in 1532. It was
founded by Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells. It is in length, from
east to west, 210 feet; length of the cross aisles, from north to south, 126
feet; breadth of the body and aisles, 72 feet; height of the tower, 152
feet; and the height of the roof, or vaulting, 78 feet. The west window
is of extreme richness. The buttresses, on each side of the aisle windows,
are ornamented with rolls, containing inscriptions, not now legible, but are
said to contain the following allegorical allusion to the founder's name,
taken out of the book of Judges, chap. ix. verse 8:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Trees, going to choose their king,<br />
Said&mdash;be to us the Olive king."
</p>

<p>The windows of this church, fifty-two in number, are supposed to have
given rise to its appellation of the Lantern of England. Here are various
monuments, ancient and modern, and a handsome altar-piece, representing
The Wise Men's Offering, given by General Wade. Here is also a fine
specimen of monumental architecture in the little chapel, or oratory of
Prior Bird, who died in 1525. This chapel has suffered much from having
its tracery despoiled, and a part of it cut away to make room for a wooden
seat, called the Bishop's Throne. One of the most beautiful and conspicuous
monuments which ornament the transepts and nave is, that of
Bishop Montague, at the north centre end of the nave. It is an altar-tomb,
over which the effigy of the prelate in his robes, lies prostrate on its

<span class="sidenote">Quin's monumental<br />
inscription.</span>

back. Opposite to this is a pillar, bearing a neat monument, having on a
pyramid of Sienna marble, a medallion, with a half-length figure of the
witty and celebrated Quin. On a tablet below is the following inscription:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"That tongue which set the table in a roar,<br />
And charm'd the public ear, is heard no more:<br />
Closed are those eyes, the harbingers of wit,<br />
Which spake, before the tongue, what Shakspeare writ;<br />
Cold is that hand, which living was stretch'd forth,<br />
At friendship's call to succour modest worth.<br />
Here lies James Quin:&mdash;Deign, reader, to be taught,<br />
Whate'er thy strength of body, force of thought,<br />
In nature's happiest mould however cast,<br />
'To this complexion thou must come at last.'  D. GARRICK.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Ob. MDCCLXVI. Etatis LXXIII."</span>
</p>





<p>Near the last mentioned monument lies buried the celebrated Beau Nash,
long master of the ceremonies at Bath. Richard Nash was a native of
Swansea in Glamorganshire, and was born October 18, 1674. His parents


<span class="sidenote">Account of
the celebrated Beau
Nash.</span>


were in a respectable situation of life; and young Nash received a
competent classical education at Carmarthen school, from whence he was
sent to Jesus College, Oxford, at the early age of sixteen. He was intended
for the profession of the law; but this study was too dull and dry
for a person of his volatile turn. Pleasure was the goddess he adored;
and to whose service he devoted himself. He soon involved himself in an
intrigue with an artful female in Oxford, of which description there are
always numbers who are laying baits for young men of family or personal
appearance, and in consequence of this he was removed from the University.
His relations now purchased a pair of colours for him in the army; and
here his taste for gallantry and dissipation would have been fully gratified,
had not his inferior rank, and the duties attached to it, subjected him to
subordination and restraint, which appeared intolerable to a man born for
empire, and whose ruling passion was too strong to submit to control.
He, therefore, left the army in disgust, and returned to the law, which he
had discarded, by entering himself a student of the Middle Temple. Soon
afterwards Nash was presented with an opportunity of exercising his natural
talents. It had been an ancient custom with the society to which he
now belonged, to entertain every new sovereign with a revel and a pageant.
On the accession of William, Prince of Orange, Nash was selected as the
most proper person to conduct this mighty business; and he succeeded so


<span class="sidenote">Refused to
be knighted.</span>


well, that, it is said, William offered to knight him, an honour which he
declined. His abilities, however, had attracted public notice, and this
paved the way to his future success. Bath then beginning to rise into
some little repute as a place of fashionable resort, Nash was induced to
visit it in pursuit of pleasure, and soon made himself conspicuous by his
taste, wit, and gaiety. At this period, it was the fashion for both sexes to
bathe together quite naked, and for ladies to adorn their heads before they
entered the bath with all the lures of dress. By these means their charms
were set off to such advantage, that the husband of a lady in the Cross
Bath, who with Nash and other spectators were admiring the female
dabblers, told his wife "she looked like an angel, and he wished to be with
her." Nash seized the favourable occasion to establish his reputation as a
man of gallantry and spirit, and therefore suddenly taking the gentleman
by the collar and the waistband of his breeches, soused him over the
parapet into the bath. The consequence was a duel, in which Nash was
wounded in the sword-arm; and, as it does not appear he was fond of fighting,
it is probable that this incident prompted him when he rose to power,
to issue his edict against wearing swords at Bath, "except by such as
were not entitled to wear them at any other place." About this time a
vacancy happening in the office of master of the ceremonies, a place hitherto
of little profit or honour, the well known talent of Nash for the direction
and invention of amusements, operated so much in his favour, that he
was chosen "arbiter elegantiarum," and invested with the fullest power
to order, arrange, and improve, the manner of the company, routine of
amusements, and points of etiquette. Under the equal administration of


<span class="sidenote">Conduct of
Nash towards the
Princess
Amelia.</span>


Nash, no rank could protect the offender, nor any dignity of situation
influence him to connive at a breach of his laws. He deliberately desired
the Duchess of Queensbury, who appeared at a dress ball in an apron, to
take it off; and when the Princess Amelia requested to have one dance
more after eleven o'clock, he replied, that the laws of Bath, like those of
Lycurgus, were unalterable. This firmness of character was attended
with the most beneficial consequences; and Nash, not ignorant what
majesty is when stripped of its externals, took care by his dress and equipage
to support the rank he assumed. He wore a large white hat, and
drove a carriage with six greys, escorted by several persons on horseback,
and foot, with French horns and other kinds of musical instruments.
The Prince of Wales, the Prince of Orange, the nobility and gentry, all
treated him with respect; and the corporation, who might be considered
as his privy council, never took any steps without his fiat. His prosperity
was of long duration; and, if a man who supported himself by
gambling and intrigues, can be said to deserve prosperity, it was
justly due to this celebrated character: but at length age and infirmities
approached! and though Horace says, we should preserve consistency to
the last, it appeared ridiculous to see grey hairs and decrepitude aping the
gaiety and hilarity of youth. His admirers in consequence fell off; and
he lived to be sensible of the folly of a life solely devoted to pleasure, and
the vanity of pomp, whether real or affected.&mdash;Beau Nash died February


<span class="sidenote">His death.</span>


3, 1761, and was buried at the expence of the corporation, in the abbey
church, with much pomp and solemnity. The crowd that attended his
funeral was so great, that not only the streets were filled, but the very
tops of the houses were covered with spectators.&mdash;Amongst the places of


<span class="sidenote">Dissenting
Chapels.</span>


worship for the Dissenters, are the Unitarian chapel, in Trim Street; the
Baptist chapel, in Garrard Street; the Quaker's meeting-house on St.
James's Parade; the chapel of the Unitas Fratrum, or Moravians, in
Monmouth Street; a chapel belonging to the Wesleyan Methodists, in
New King Street; an Independant Calvinist chapel, in Argyle Street; a
sort of semi-episcopal chapel, in the connection of the late Countess of
Huntingdon, in Harlequin Row; and a Roman Catholic chapel in
Orchard Street. The original pump-room, began in 1704, was opened
under the auspices of Mr. Nash. Its object was to enable the drinkers
to take exercise without exposing themselves to the weather. The room
was enlarged in 1751; a portico, stretching from it in a northerly direction,
was added in 1786; and a superb western frontispiece in 1791.
Five years afterwards, Mr. Baldwin the architect, erected a new pump-room
on the site of the old one, on a more extensive and magnificent
scale. During the full season, a company of musicians perform in the
gallery every morning. Those who drink the waters, are expected to pay
about a guinea per month, besides a gratuity to the pumper. The public
baths are the King's Bath, and Queen's Bath, which are connected with
each other; the Hot Bath, and the Cross Bath. The private baths are
those belonging to the corporation, in Stall Street, adjoining the King's
Bath, built in 1788, with dry pumps, sudatories, and every other accommodation;
and the neat and convenient baths, called the Duke of Kingston's,
or the Abbey Baths, belonging to Earl Manvers. The latter are
supplied from the same source as the great pump-room. The Bath
springs are said to have three distinct sources, the King's Bath, the Hot
Bath, and the Cross Bath, which arise within a small distance of each
other. They contain a small quantity of carbonic acid gas, and also of
azotic gas; some sulphate of soda, and muriate of soda; selenite, carbonate
of lime; siliceous earth; and a portion of oxyd of iron. These
waters, taken internally, operate as a stimulant; they increase the action
of the blood-vessels, and promote the various secretions, particularly those


<span class="sidenote">Use of the
waters in
certain disorders.</span>


of urine and perspiration. The diseases in which their external and internal
uses render most service, are affections of the liver and stomach,
jaundice, hypochondriasis, and chlorosis. They are especially efficacious
in that state of gout termed atonic. The external application of the water
is highly beneficial in palsy, chronic rheumatism, cutaneous diseases,
scrofula, lameness, contractions, &amp;c. The water, in all cases, should if
practicable, be drunk hot from the pump. Its effect on the stomach and
nerves are sometimes remarkably speedy; persons who have lost their
appetites and spirits by high living, have, by using them a few days, recovered
their powers of digestion and cheerfulness of mind. The quantity
taken is seldom more than a pint and a half in the course of the day,
and is divided into three portions, two before breakfast, allowing half an
hour between them, and a third at noon. The condition of the patient is,
however, to be strictly attended to: and the quantity must be regulated
at the discretion of the physician. The General Hospital of this city was
established for the reception of all the sick poor in the united kingdom,
whose complaints require relief from the springs of the place; excepting
the resident poor, who have the advantage of taking the waters at their
own houses, at a moderate charge. Edward the Sixth granted upwards
of eighty tenements, gardens, &amp;c. within the city and its suburbs, for the
purpose of founding a grammar-school at Bath, and maintaining ten
poor folk within the said town for ever. The Bath Theatre is scarcely
inferior to those of the metropolis. The present building was erected


<span class="sidenote">The Theatre.</span>


about the year 1805, in the centre of the city; and from its height, it
forms a prominent object in the distance from all its environs. There
are three entrances; the grand front being in Beaufort Square. The audience
part is somewhat smaller than was that of the late Covent Garden
Theatre, but the space behind the curtain is much larger. The length,
within the main walls, is one hundred and twenty feet; the breadth sixty
feet; and the height seventy. The exterior buildings are very extensive;
there are three lofty tiers of boxes, affording a depth of rows towards the
centre. Cast iron bronzed pillars are placed at a distance of two feet from
the front, by which the first row of each circle appears as a balcony, independent
of the main structure, and thus an inconceivable lightness is
obtained. The private boxes are inclosed with gilt lattices: the entrance
to them is by a private house, part of the property connected with the
theatre, and they are accommodated with a suite of retiring rooms. The
decorations are very splendid, particularly the ceiling. The Harmonic
Society was instituted under the patronage of Dr. Harrington; and there
is another musical society, called the York House Catch Club. The Sydney


<span class="sidenote">Sydney
Gardens.</span>


Garden Vauxhall, at the extremity of Great Pulteney Street, abounds
with groves, vistas, lawns, serpentine walks, alcoves, bowling-greens, grottoes
and labyrinths. It is known to have contained four thousand persons.
The riding school affords the public, amusement in wet weather. Lansdown
races are in June and July. Besides the Public Library, the circulating
libraries are numerous and well supplied, and the harmonic concerts
and local institutions of a literary character, are easily accessible. It

<p>[A] BATHEASTON. This village is situated on the London road from
Bath. The upper part contains the church, and amongst some handsome
houses, is one which was formerly the residence of John Wood, Esq., the
ingenious architect, to whom Bath owes many of its noblest buildings.
The church is antique. At the west-end it has a fine square tower, one
hundred feet high. The inside is remarkable for its neat and decent appearance.
A custom long observed at the villa of Sir John Millar, Bart.,
displays his elegance and refinement in the choice of his amusements, as
well as of his visitors. He had purchased an antique vase, discovered at
Frescati, in Italy, in 1759; and having placed it in a room convenient for
the purpose, he consecrated it to Apollo, and ordained Lady Miller, high
priestess. He then issued a general invitation to all votaries of the muses,
to assemble on a certain day in each week, and offer their poetical oblations


<span class="sidenote">The vase of
Apollo.</span>


at the shrine; the degree of merit each possessed was decided by
the public voice, and the author of the best was crowned with myrtle. A
collation succeeded. This attic pastime continued for some years, till
some witling contaminated the purity of the urn by a licentious composition,
and the vessel was closed for ever. Two small volumes of these
effusions have been published.</p>




<p>[B] BATTERSEA is seated on the Thames, and gives the title of Baron
to the family of St. John. The church contains many monuments, chiefly
of the above noble family; particularly one in grey marble, to the memory
of the celebrated statesman, Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, and
of his second wife, whose profiles are sculptured in bass-relief. A monument
near the south wall, represents Sir Edward Wynter in the act of


<span class="sidenote">Sir E.
Wynter's
exploits.</span>


performing two extraordinary exploits, thus described in his epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
Alone, unarmed, a tyger he oppressed,<br />
And crush'd to death the monster of a beast.<br />
Twice twenty mounted Moors he overthrew,<br />
Singly on foot, some wounded, some he slew,<br />
Dispersed the rest&mdash;what more could Sampson do?<br />
</p>

<p>A neat tablet, at the east end of the church, commemorates Thomas Astle,
who was long a distinguished member of the Society of Antiquaries,
Keeper of the Records in the Tower, a Trustee of the British Museum,
and author of Treatise "on the Origin and Progress of Writing." He
died in 1802, and left a valuable collection of manuscripts. Here are also
interred, Arthur Collins, Esq., known as the author of an "Historical
Account of the Peers and Baronets of England;" William Curtis, author
of the "Flora Londinensis," and the Rev. Joseph Gardner, author of
"Views on the Rhine," and otherwise distinguished by his attachment
to the arts. Bolingbroke House was a spacious edifice, said to have contained


<span class="sidenote">Bolingbroke
house.</span>


fifty rooms on a floor, of which a few only remain; among which
is the favourite apartment of Lord Bolingbroke, wainscotted with cedar.
A horizontal air-mill now occupies the site of this mansion, and in the
gardens have been erected bullock-houses. Sherwood Lodge, near the
Thames, is the residence of James Wolf, Esq. whose valuable collection
of plaster-casts, from antique statues, are deposited in a gallery of Doric
architecture, remarkable for the purity of its style. A wooden bridge was
built over the Thames at this place, in 1771.</p>

<p>[A] BATTLE, anciently called Epiton, derived its present denomination
from the conflict between William the Norman, and Harold Harefoot,
which decided the fate of these realms, and gave to the former the
surname of Conqueror. This engagement happened on the 14th of
October, 1066, and continued from morning until sunset, when the Normans
had sustained a loss of 15000 men, and the English four times that
number, among whom was their king. The Conqueror, grateful for his
victory, and in performance of a vow, commenced the foundation of an
abbey on that part of the field where the battle had raged most fiercely,
causing the high altar to be raised on the spot where the body of his
valiant antagonist; or, as others say, his standard had been found. This


<span class="sidenote">The Abbey.</span>


abbey was dedicated to St. Martin, and the privileges enjoyed by the
superiors within its precincts were almost regal; an exclusive right of
inquest in cases of murder&mdash;the property of all treasure discovered there&mdash;free
warren and exemption, even for their tenants, from all ecclesiastical
jurisdiction&mdash;right of sanctuary for their church in cases of homicide&mdash;and
the power of pardoning any condemned thief whom they should meet
going to execution. From the foundation of this abbey, till its dissolution,
it was governed by thirty-one abbots. Sometime after the latter
period, it was the property of the Montagues, who sold it to Sir Thomas
Webster, and that gentleman made it his residence. Sir Godfrey Webster,
Bart., is the present owner. In its present state, Battle Abbey bears
ample testimony to its ancient magnificence, the ruins being extensive,
and exhibiting a mixture of the light Norman with the solid Saxon architecture.
These remains occupy two sides of a quadrangle, of which one
is an ancient gateway. Nine elegant arches, now filled up, are all that
remain of the church. Two detached buildings, supposed to have been
refectories, are now converted into offices. The town of Battle consists
of one street, and has a handsome church, the windows of which
are embellished with stained glass. The chancel contains a fine altar-monument
to the memory of Sir Anthony Browne, armour-bearer to
Henry VIII. This place is celebrated for a manufacture of gunpowder,
inferior only to that at Dartford.</p>

<p>[B] BATTLE. The church is placed upon an eminence on the east side
of the Escir river. It is a low edifice surrounded by a cemetry, bounded
by a wall. A few straggling houses give this place the name of a village.
History has fixed this spot as the scene of action where the fate of Brecknockshire


<span class="sidenote">Scene of a
Welsh
battle.</span>


was decided, upon its attack by Bernard Newmarch. The vestiges
which indicate such an event, are, a well called Ffynon Pen Rhys; a
lane called Heol y Cymri, and a long upright stone below the church
on the south side; no other vestiges remain to recall the event. Half a
mile eastward from Battle, appears the stately residence of the vicar of
Llandevalle. Upon the wall of an inner court is an inscription in Latin.
From the windows of this house are three most beautiful views; on the
east side through a small vista, are seen the village of Llanddew, and in
the back ground the black mountain beyond Talgarth. From the library,
in which is a capital picture of our Saviour bearing the Cross, by Correggio,
looking west, is the vale of Usk, with the highly ornamented grounds
above Penpont; beyond which, Abercamlais, and the mountains in Llywel
and Devynock close the scene. Nearly opposite is the gradually rising
knoll of Benni, covered to the top on all sides with wood, beyond which
appear the precipitous and majestic summits of the Beacons. Merthyr
Cynog, or Saint Cynog, lies about four miles north. Cynog or Canoc,
was the illegitimate son of Brychan Brecheinog. He was slain or murdered
in one of the early eruptions of the Saxons into Wales, in the
5th century, on the summit of a hill in this parish, nearly opposite
Castlemadoc, called Vanoleu, and according to Owen, was buried in Merthyr
church. The edifice which remains, does not appear to be of an
earlier date than the Norman era; it is situated upon a lofty ridge between
the vales of Escir fawr and Escir fechan, in nearly the centre of the parish.
It resembles a large barn, in which are some divisions, like pens for sheep,
thrown in disorder to rot, when unfit for use.</p>

<p>[A] BATTLEDEN lies between the two great north-western roads.
The family of Firmband, or Fremband, twice represented the county in
parliament, as early as the reign of Edward III. In the reign of Elizabeth
it became the property of the Duncombes; and it is to one of this family
that we are indebted for the accommodation of the now antiquated sedans,


<span class="sidenote">The invention
of Sedan
chairs.</span>


or close chairs; and in the year 1634, Duncombe is said to have procured
a patent, which vested in him and his heirs the right of carrying persons
"up and down in them," for a certain term. "It is probable, (observes
Lysons,) that Sir Saunders, who was a great traveller, had seen them at
Sedan, where Dr. Johnson, supposes that they were first made; and it is
remarkable that Captain Bayley first introduced the use of Hackney
Coaches in the same year." In the year 1706, this manor was purchased
by Allen Bathurst, Esq., a distinguished political character during the
reigns of Queen Anne and George I. It was for many years the country
seat of Lord Bathurst, and the resort of a celebrated constellation of
wits, of whom he was the patron and friend.</p>



<p>[B] BATTLEFIELD is a parish in the liberties of Shrewsbury, and
derives its name from a sanguinary battle which was fought there on
Saturday the 21st of July, 1403, between Henry the Fourth and the


<span class="sidenote">Battle between
Henry the
Fourth and
Percy of
Northumberland.</span>


Rebels, under Percy, Earl of Nothumberland, and in which Lord Henry
Percy, well known as the valiant Hotspur, was slain, together with
nearly 2300 gentlemen and others, and upwards of 600 common soldiers
fell on that memorable occasion. After this signal victory, Henry the
fourth caused a collegiate church to be erected on the spot for secular
canons, which was dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene, the battle having
been fought on the anniversary of that day. This college was dissolved
in the general wreck of establishments of this kind, when its revenues
amounted to &pound;54 10s. 4d. per annum; it is now the parish church. At
the east end, over the altar window, is a figure of Henry the Fourth,
much defaced by the corroding hand of time. In a niche in the south
wall, is a rude carving in wood of the Virgin and child; and in the east
window are still to be traced some mutilated remains of stained glass;
but the most interesting object in this church, is a splendid gothic
monument, recently erected to the memory of the late John Corbet,
Esq. of Sundorne. This beautiful specimen of architecture is called


<span class="sidenote">Splendid
monument.</span>


the Tudor gothic; the interior represents the miniature aisle of a cathedral
or cloister, with its elaborately groined roof, and the front is adorned by the
heraldic blazonings of the family. This fine and highly prized piece of art
was designed by the Rev. Archdeacon Owen, of Shrewsbury, and most admirably
executed by Messrs. Carline of that town, in a warmly tinted fine
grained stone, from the Grinshill quarries in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>[A] BAWTRY is a small town situated on the edge of Yorkshire, adjoining
Nottinghamshire. It is handsome and well built; and the high
street, through which lies the great North Road from London to Edinburgh,
is very broad, and contains some elegant houses. At the upper part of
this street is the market-place, in which are some excellent shambles.
The town stands on a gentle but pleasant eminence, which slopes from the
north and east down to the river Idle, which river is navigable to this
place for small craft. On the western side of the town the ground is high
and exceedingly pleasant, but the eastern, or marshy side, is subject to
frequent winter inundations. The object which most travellers consider
more especially worthy of attention, is the elegant mansion of the Viscountess
Galway. The edifice is built of brick and is pleasantly situated
at the southern extremity of the town; it has an extensive and handsome
front, but a high brick wall secludes it from public view. The pleasure


<span class="sidenote">Seat of the

grounds which are kept in excellent condition, are stocked with Chinese
pheasants, and other rare and curious birds. Near this place the Archbishops
of York had a palace; and at this mansion, Archbishop Savage,
in the time of Henry VII. delighted to take his pleasure in hunting; and
in the next reign it was the residence of Cardinal Wolsey. The palace
stood in a very low and damp situation, close to the confluence of the
small river Ryton with the Idle. The great gateway, and the porter's
lodge, were taken down towards the end of the last century, and what
remains of the palace has been converted into a farm house.</p>

<p>[B] BAYSWATER is situated on the Oxford Road, and is the first place
passed after leaving London; it has been much increased of late by the
building of new streets and genteel residences. A reservoir, under the
same management as the water works of Chelsea, is in the neighbourhood.
Bayswater Tea Gardens were formerly the Botanic gardens of Sir
John Hill, who cultivated there his medicinal plants, and prepared his
Water Dock, Essence, and Balsam of Honey. The reservoir before mentioned,
was intended for the supply of the palace at Kensington, and the
bason before the palace was to be kept constantly full by the proprietors;
and, it was upon this condition that the property was granted them. It
now supplies that part of the city estates situated in about Bond-street,
with water.</p>

<p>[A] BEACHAMPTON. The remains of the mansion of the Bennetts
have been converted into a farm-house, but the great hall is still standing.
In the parish church are some monuments of this family; among which
there is one to the memory of Sir Simon Bennett, who was created a
baronet in 1627, and is recorded in history as having been a great friend
to the poor, and to University College, Oxford. This monument, it appears,
was set up by the college 100 years after his death, and great blame
is imputed to them for having delayed it so long. Mr. William Elmer,


<span class="sidenote">Free grammar
school.</span>


by his will, bearing date 1648, founded a free grammar school in this
parish. The school-house was finished in 1667. The master, by an
express clause in the founder's will, must be a single man, and is to reside
in the school-house. It is endowed with lands, which are charged with
the payment of a certain pension of &pound;2. per annum, to eight poor men,
and &pound;1. per annum to as many poor women; and it is further provided,
that three of each of these shall be inhabitants of this parish.</p>



<p>[B] BEACHLEY from its almost insulated situation, has always been of
great importance in a military point of view, for there are extensive earthworks
of British origin still remaining. Offa's-dyke, which terminates
here, is still to be traced. In the civil wars this place was considered of
much importance, for Prince Rupert despatched a body of 500 horse and
foot to occupy and fortify it. But history relates, that even before the
fortifications were completed, the garrison was dislodged with great loss,
by Governor Massie. After this, a battle was fought between the royalists
and the parliamentary forces, under Sir John Wyntor, when the latter
was defeated with the loss of 220 men; and it is currently reported that


<span class="sidenote">Once a
place of
great importance.</span>


he himself was forced to leap from the cliff into the river Severn, where a
small boat lay ready to receive him; it is certain the place still goes by
the name of "Wyntor's leap." The ferry over the river Severn has been
before mentioned at page 63. Here is an inn called Beachley Passage
House Inn. The time of high water is nearly the same as at Bristol
Quay, and is always to be seen in the Bristol Newspapers. If the wind
be northerly, this passage may be crossed for five hours before high-water;
and if the wind be southerly or westerly, it may be passed for seven hours
after high-water.</p>



<p>[C] BEACONSFIELD is a small place, although it is one of great
thoroughfare, but the market is almost wholly disused; in fact, Wycombe
and Uxbridge appear to have drawn away the business. The manor,
anciently an estate of the Windsors, afterwards became the property of the
Monks of Burnham Abbey, a building but a few miles distant. Edmund


<span class="sidenote">Waller, the
poet.</span>


Waller, the poet, was born at Coleshill, in this neighbourhood, at which
place see his life; he was proprietor of the very pleasing seat, called Hall
Barns, an ancient mansion belonging to the family; he lies buried in the
churchyard, and a monument has been erected to his memory, with a
latin inscription, too long and too dry to be given in our work. Gregories,
in this parish, was the seat of the celebrated Edmund Burke, who,
for critical taste and brilliancy of language, will ever be ranked amongst the
most fascinating of English writers. His company was sought for by all


<span class="sidenote">The celebrated
Edmund Burke.</span>


who could make the slightest pretension to kindred genius. He died in
this town, and was buried in the church, where a marble tablet is set
up, with a short inscription, to his memory. The apartments at Butler's
Court, formerly Gregories, contained some fine paintings, by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and some valuable marbles. This seat, we believe,
came into the possession of Mr. Burke through the friendship of Lord
Verney and the Marquis of Rockingham, by whose munificence he was
enabled to purchase it. The widow of the late Mr. Burke continued to
reside at Butler's Court till the period of her death, which took place a
few years after that of her late husband; the mansion and estate was
afterwards purchased by James Dupre, Esq., who let the house to the
master of a boarding-school, and in whose occupation it was destroyed by
fire: the grounds have since been adapted to the purpose of agriculture. For
the following interesting sketch of the illustrious and distinguished statesman,
(Burke,) we are indebted to Dr. Watkin's Biographical Dictionary:&mdash;"He
was born at Dublin, in 1730. His father was an attorney, and a
Protestant. The son received his education under Abraham Shackleton,
a Quaker, who kept a school at Ballytore, near Carlow, and it is recorded
to the honour of Mr. Burke, that whenever he visited Ireland he always
paid his respects to his old tutors: in 1746 he entered as a scholar at


<span class="sidenote">Sketch of
his life.</span>


Trinity College, which he left on taking his bachelor's degree in 1749, and
soon after became candidate for the professorship of logic at Glasgow, but
did not succeed. In 1753 he entered of the Middle Temple, where he
applied more to general literature than to the law, and supported himself
by writing for the booksellers. Falling ill, through too close an application
to his studies, he removed to the house of Dr. Nugent, a physician,
whose daughter he afterwards married. In 1756 he published a pamphlet,
entitled, "A Vindication of Natural Society." This piece was purposely
drawn up in the manner of Lord Bolingbroke, and for a time imposed
upon the friends of that writer as his real productions. His next performance
was the Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, published in 1757.
This philosophical piece of criticism, written in a fine and elegant style,
procured the author a great reputation, and the esteem of the first literary
characters of the age; the principal of whom was Dr. Johnson. In 1758, he
suggested to Mr. Dodsley, the bookseller, the plan of the "Annual Register,"
the historical part of which he wrote for several years. In 1761 he went
to Ireland as the companion of his friend Mr. Hamilton, secretary to the
Earl of Halifax, then Lord-Lieutenant. That gentleman, who was generally
known by the name of Single-speech Hamilton, from the circumstance
of his making only one speech in parliament, but one of uncommon eloquence,
procured him a pension of &pound;300. on the Irish establishment. On
his return from Ireland he was made private secretary to the Marquis of
Rockingham, First Lord of the Treasury, who brought him into parliament
for Wendover. The Rockingham party continued in power but a
short time, and on going out of office, Mr. Burke wrote a forcible
pamphlet upon the subject, entitled, "A Short Account of a Short Administration;"
after which, he became an active member of the opposition,
as a senator and also as a writer. A pamphlet of his, entitled, "Thoughts
on the Causes of the present Discontents," excited considerable interest as
a bold exposure of court intrigues and favourites, in controlling the operations
of ministers. In the struggle between Great Britain and the
colonies, Mr. Burke bore a distinguished part as an opponent to the
ministry. His speeches were vehement, and had so powerful an influence
upon the people, that the citizens of Bristol, in 1774, invited him to be one of
their representatives, without his being at the least expense. But at the
next election in 1780, he was rejected by them for having supported the
Irish petition for a free trade, and the bill for relieving Roman Catholics.
He was then returned for Malton, in Yorkshire. At this time he gained great
popularity by his introduction of a bill for a reform in the national expenditure,
on which he spent prodigious labour, but it was unsuccessful.
When the Marquis of Rockingham returned to power on the resignation
of Lord North, in 1782, Mr. Burke obtained the post of Paymaster-general
of the Forces, and a seat in the Privy Council; but this was of short
duration, for on the death of his patron, Lord Shelbourne became First
Lord of the Treasury, and Mr. Burke, with several of his friends, resigned
their places. In the coalition, which for a little while succeeded the Shelbourne
administration, Mr. Burke had his share both of emolument and
abuse. The leading particulars of his political life, after this, were his
exertions against Mr. Hastings, in which he manifested uncommon industry
to fasten guilt upon that gentleman, with no small share of personal
asperity; his vigorous opposition to Mr. Pitt's design of forming a limited
regency on the King's illness in 1788; and above all, his ardour against
the actors and defenders of the French revolution. On the latter subject
he evinced peculiar sagacity at the outset, and when many worthy men
were rejoicing at the prospect of rising liberty and happiness to the world,
Mr. Burke predicted, with remarkable precision, the desolation, bloodshed,
anarchy, and misery which ensued. He displayed his detestation of the
revolutionists in the House of Commons, and separated himself in consequence
from Mr. Fox, and many other of his old associates. In 1790
he published his famous "Reflections on the Revolution in France,"
which attracted wonderful attention, and produced a surprising effect upon
the public mind. Many publications appeared in answer to this book;
the most noted of which was Paine's pamphlet, entitled "The Rights of
Man," wherein the principles of republicanism were so artfully addressed
to the feelings of ordinary persons, as to excite for a time no small alarm
to the friends of government. Mr. Burke, after this, published a variety


<span class="sidenote">Burke's reflections
on the
French
revolution, &amp;c.</span>


of pamphlets in support of his positions: as, "A Letter to a Member of
the National Assembly;" "An Appeal from the New Whigs to the
Old;" "Thoughts on a Regicide peace," &amp;c. His zeal on this occasion,
as well as his extraordinary talents, recommended him to the royal
favour, and he obtained a pension, which gave room for those who had
been galled by his arguments, to reproach him, and some illiberal animadversions
were made upon him in the senate, which drew from him
that admirable defence, his "Letter to a Noble Lord," in which he retaliates
upon a celebrated Duke in a strain of keen irony and dignified
remonstrance. Mr. Burke withdrew from parliament in 1794, leaving his
seat for Malton to his son, an accomplished young man, who died shortly
after. This melancholy event hastened his death, which happened the 8th


<span class="sidenote">His death.</span>


of July, 1797. A little before his death he caused to be read to him
Addison's paper in the Spectator, on the Immortality of the Soul. Mr.
Burke was very amiable in his private life, of correct deportment, faithful in
his attachments; charitable to the poor, and religious without being superstitious.
He had a fine taste for the arts, and was fond of gardening
and architecture," Bulstrode, the seat of the Duke of Portland, is within
three miles of the town; a more detailed account of this elegant mansion
will be given in a future portion of our work.</p>

<p>[A] BEAMINSTER is a town of very great antiquity; it is situated on a
fertile spot near the banks of the small river Birt. The prebendaries of
Salisbury were formerly lords of the manor, until the parliamentary commissioners
(who appear to have made very free with church property)
seized it, and for a time it passed into other hands, but it was only for a
time: the right at length became acknowledged, and in the possession of
the prebendaries of Sarum it now remains. This town has suffered much
by the devastation of fire, and still more by the destructive sword of civil,
or rather uncivil, warfare. Britton speaks of a record of the former being
preserved in a blank leaf of an old Bible, in the possession of a gentleman
of this town, which memorandum ran as follows:&mdash;"The towne of Beaminster
was burnt on Palme Sunday, being the 14th day of April, and in


<span class="sidenote">Destroyed
by fire in
1644.</span>


the year of our Lord 1644. At the same time prince Maurice, being in
the towne seven dayes before the fire, and there continued till the fire burnt
him out of his quarters. The fire was first kindled in John Sergeant's
house, in North-street; it was a musket discharged in the gable; and it
was wild-fire, and the winde lying directly with the towne, the whole
place was destroyed in two hours; and those goods for the most part
which were saved out of the fire were carried away by the soldiers. There
were seven score and four dwelling-houses, besides barns and stables,
burnt." An eye-witness in Sir Thomas Fairfax's army describes it
as "a place of the pitifullest spectacle that man can behold; hardly
a house left not consumed by fire." Two thousand pounds were granted
by the parliament to assist in re-building the town: this, with other
sums, raised by the neighbouring gentry, answered the purpose. But
it appears that the place was doomed to destruction, for in June, 1684, it


<span class="sidenote">Burnt down
in 1684, and
again in
1781.</span>


was again consumed, and the loss is said to have amounted to &pound;10,000.:
nor did its misfortunes end here, for in the gusty month of March, in the
year 1781, upwards of fifty dwelling-houses, besides barns, stables, and
other buildings, were reduced to ruins in the short space of three hours.
Mrs. Tucker founded a free-school here, in 1684, for the purpose of affording
education to twenty of the poorest boys in the town; three or four of
these boys were to be apprenticed annually, and it is necessary that one of
these, at least, should become a seaman. The Rev. Mr. Samuel Hood,
father of Lord Hood, was master of this school in the year 1715. The
inhabitants are principally engaged in the manufacture of sail-cloth, and
in the production of iron, tin, and copper ware. The work-house is a large
commodious building; formerly an alms-house.</p>

<p>[B] BEAUDESERT. This place is situated in the hundred of Barlichway.
The church is dedicated to St. Nicholas, and exhibits some good specimens
of ancient architecture. The village was the birth-place of Richard Jago,
the poet, who was the son of the rector: he was born in 1715, and was
educated at Solihull grammar-school, about eleven miles distant from this
place. His first poetical production which attracted notice was an
"Elegy on the Death of a Blackbird," and this was followed by a poem,
descriptive of the "Battle of Edgehill," which is considered the most
finished of his works: the subject was in all probability suggested by his
residence in the neighbourhood of the scene of action. He died on the
8th of April, 1781.</p>

<p>[A] BEAULIEU. The river Exe, over which there is a bridge, is navigable
up to this village. Here is a manufacture of coarse sacking. The
ruins of Beaulieu Abbey are beautifully situated on the eastern banks of
the river. The delightful valley which surrounds these venerable remains,
is of a circular form, bounded by well-wooded hills, and in itself, consists
of a rich variety of ground. The Abbey was founded, A.D. 1204, by


<span class="sidenote">The Abbey
founded by
King John.</span>


King John, for monks of the Cistercian order; a class of friars to
which that monarch had been previously particularly adverse. The king,
it is said, after various oppressive measures exercised against the Cistercians,
summoned the Abbots and principals of that order, to Lincoln,
whither they hastened, flattering themselves that he would there confer
upon them some marks of his grace and favor. Instead of this, say the
monkish historians, "the savage monarch ordered the Abbots to be
trodden to death, by horses: but none of his attendants being found
sufficiently cruel to obey the sanguinary command, the ecclesiastics,
dreadfully alarmed, retired hastily to their inn. In the course of the ensuing
night, when the monarch slumbered on his bed, he dreamt that he
was standing before a Judge, accompanied by the Cistercian Abbots, who
were commanded to scourge him severely with rods and thongs; and
when he awoke in the morning, he declared that he still felt the smart of
the beating. On relating this dream to a certain ecclesiastic of his court,


<span class="sidenote">The king's
singular
dream.</span>


he was advised to crave pardon of the Abbots, whom he had before so
barbarously treated; and assured, that the Almighty had been infinitely
merciful to him, in thus revealing the mysteries of his dispensations, and
affording him paternal correction. The king, adopting this counsel,
ordered the Abbots to attend him; and, contrary to their expectations,
received them with kindness:" and the remembrance of his dream still
continuing to influence his conduct, he shortly after granted a charter for
the foundation of the Abbey of Beaulieu. It was greatly enriched by
succeeding grants; and at the Dissolution, its possessions were estimated
at the annual value of &pound;428. 6s. 8d. The manor of Beaulieu, with all its
rights, privileges, and appurtenances, (the rectory and right of patronage
excepted), was granted to Thomas Wriothesley, Esq. afterwards Earl of
Southampton. The circumference of the manor embraces an extent of 28


<span class="sidenote">The manor
extends 28
miles.</span>


miles, and the clear annual revenue amounts to between &pound;4000 and &pound;5000.
The immediate precincts of the Abbey were encircled by a stone wall, the
remains of which are richly mantled with ivy. An edifice, nearly square,
now called the palace, but originally built for the Abbot's lodging, was
converted into a family seat after the Dissolution. Over the entrance is
a canopied niche, in which stood the image of the Virgin Mary. The hall
is a well proportioned room, handsomely vaulted, the ribs springing from
pilasters, and spreading over the roof in beautiful ramifications. Eastward
from this edifice is a long building, supposed from the extent and
height of the apartments, to have been the dormitory; beneath it are
several good cellars. The ancient kitchen is also standing, and near it is
the refectory, a plain stone edifice, with strong buttresses: this is now the
parish church of Beaulieu; the Abbey church, which stood to the north-east,
having been entirely destroyed. On the west side is the ancient
rostrum, or pulpit, from which lectures were read when the monks were
assembled at their meals below. The site of the Abbey Church may be
traced by the unevenness of the ground; but not a vestige of the building is
remaining. Fragments of demolished tombs are occasionally dug up here,
this having been the burial-place of various illustrious and noble personages,


<span class="sidenote">Burial place
of Queen
Eleanor.</span>


and among them, Queen Eleanor, mother of King John.
Some traces of the cloisters are yet distinguishable. Whilst Beaulieu
Abbey was invested with the privilege of a sanctuary, its walls afforded a
temporary protection to Margaret of Anjou, Queen of Henry VI.; who,
returning from the continent, in expectation of being reinstated in her former
dignity, was informed of the imprisonment of her husband, the destruction
of his army, and the death of the Earl of Warwick, and the
elevation to the throne of Edward IV. Another celebrated fugitive, to
whom this abbey afforded sanctuary, was Perkin Warbeck, who, after
many vicissitudes, was executed at Tyburn, in 1499.</p>

<p>[A] BEAUMARIS, though but a small place, is the capital of the island;
it is finely situated on a low shore, called Beaumaris Bay. The present
town appears to have originated from the circumstance of a castle having
been erected here about the close of the 13th century, by Edward I. It lies


<span class="sidenote">Chief town
in Anglesea.</span>


close to the town, covering a large space of ground, in a low situation. Its
erection was subsequent to its proud rivals Conway and Caernarvon. The
necessity of the present castle arose from Rhyddlan, upon the opposite
shore, being often possessed by the Welsh princes. It appears to have
been the last of the three great fortresses erected by Edward. On the
conquest of Wales in 1295, he fixed upon this spot with a view of surrounding
it with a fosse, for the double purpose of defence, and bringing
small craft to unload their cargoes under its walls, by a canal, part of
which was, till lately, remaining. From the period of its erection to the
time of Charles I., it does not appear to have been at all conspicuous on
the page of history. A communication was made between various parts
of the inner court, by means of a surrounding gallery, about six feet wide,
a considerable portion of which is yet entire. Within recesses, in the
sides of the gallery, are several square apertures, apparently once furnished
with trap doors, which opened into rooms beneath; but their use has not
been ascertained. Mr. Grose thinks they might have been used for the
purposes of imprisonment. A tennis, fives court, and bowling-green, have
been formed within the interior. The town of Beaumaris was surrounded
with walls, for its defence, and placed under the government of a corporation,
endowed with various privileges and lands. Mr. Lloyd supposes,
from local tokens being circulated by opulent tradesmen, about the year
1650, of which he had several in his possession, that it was a place of
considerable traffic. The present town consists of several streets, of which
one terminated by the castle is handsome, and the houses are generally
well built. Beaumaris is much frequented during the summer months, by


<span class="sidenote">Much frequented
in summer.</span>


numerous genteel families, attracted by the pleasantness of this part of the
island, and to avail themselves of the benefit of sea-bathing. The parochial
church is a handsome structure, consisting of a chancel, nave, and two
aisles, with a large square embattled tower. In the vestry adjoining were
deposited the remains of lady Beatrice Herbert, daughter of the celebrated
mirror of chivalry, the Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Near which lies interred
the Rev. Gronwy Davies, with an inscription concluding as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Here lies learning, friendship, love;<br />
And innocency of the dove.<br />
Within this grave and in the dust<br />
His ever courteous body must<br />
Until the resurrection lie;<br />
Then he shall live and death shall die."<br />
</p>

<p>The free-school was erected and liberally endowed by David Hughes, Esq.,
in the year 1603, who ten years afterwards founded also an excellent
alms-house for six poor persons, to whom he granted small annuities. He
was born about the middle of the 16th century, in a cottage now in ruins.
He left the island early in life, in a very humble station, but by prudence
and propriety of conduct, he made a decent fortune.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"'T is here the active worth of Hughes appears,<br />
A blessed asylum for the wreck of years!<br />
If there his views the opening mind engage,<br />
Here he supports the trembling limbs of age;<br />
His breast embrac'd within his godlike plan,<br />
At once the morn and evening hours of man!<br />
And ye who here his lasting bounty share,<br />
Whose tranquil days decline without a care!<br />
If still, as night shall close, day greet your eyes,<br />
No grateful aspirations reach the skies,<br />
Indignant heaven beholds you with a frown,<br />
Nor gives the ingrate, life's immortal crown."   <span class="smcap">Lloyd.</span>
</p>

<p>The old town-hall, built in 1563, has been taken down, and under the
patronage of Lord Viscount Bulkeley, another more elegant has been
erected upon its site. The town, re-incorporated in the 4th year of Elizabeth,
is governed by a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, twenty-four burgessess,


<span class="sidenote">Its government.</span>


two serjeants at mace, a town clerk, jailor, four constables, and a
water-bailiff. The county hall is a small low building, being neither conveniently
formed nor respectable in its appearance. The custom-house
stands upon the green near the edge of the water. Beaumaris bay consists
of an expansive opening in front of the town, so sheltered by the island of
Priesholme and the great Ormeshead, as to allow vessels of considerable
burden to ride in safety, during the most stormy weather. The depth of
water near the town, at ebb-tide, is from six to seven fathoms, but the
channel scarcely exceeds a quarter of a mile in breadth. The greater part
of the bay is left dry for several miles when the tide is out, which part is
called the Lavan Sands. These once formed a habitable hundred, belonging
to the territory of Arson. They were formerly called Wylofaen, or
the place of Weeping, from the shrieks and lamentations of the inhabitants
at the time when the land was overwhelmed by the sea. Lavan is a corruption


<span class="sidenote">Lavan sands</span>


of Traeth Talaven, or the fermented heap, allusive to the boiling up of water
in the quicksands. The ferry was granted by charter to the corporation in
the 4th year of Elizabeth: it lies near the town. The place of embarking
or landing is the point anciently known under the appellation of Penrhyn
Safness, but afterwards Osmund's Air, from a malefactor, who on his way
to execution, being asked where he was going, answered, "To take the
air." The walk over the sand at low water is firm and good; they should
be passed three hours after high water, and will be safe for four hours; or
in other words, two hours before low water and two after. Precautions
are essentially necessary to be taken, for near the times of the sands being


<span class="sidenote">Caution.</span>


covered by the sea they are frequently shifting, and in many places become
so watery or quick, as to have proved both dangerous and fatal. This way
is equally perilous in foggy weather, but as some persons are necessitated
to pass in every season, the large bell at Aber is humanely rung, to direct
them towards the sound.</p>

<p>[A] BECCLES is a large and well-built town, situated on the river Waveny,
which is navigable from this place to Yarmouth, and divides in its course
the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk. It is governed by a portreeve and thirty-six
burgesses, the office of the former being held in rotation by twelve
of the latter. The church is gothic, with a steeple, containing twelve
bells, and a porch, which is considered a fine specimen of the florid gothic.
The ruins of Endgate church may be seen out of the town, but the inhabitants


<span class="sidenote">Fine gothic

of the village appear to have been long esteemed parishioners of
Beccles. Here is a theatre, a town hall, a jail, and a free school,
endowed with 100 acres of land, in the reign of James I.; and a good
grammar-school founded by Dr. Falconberge, and endowed with an estate,

<p>[B] BECKENHAM. The church of this village is a neat edifice, containing
many monuments of the Style, Raymond, Burrell, and other
families. On a slab in the chancel, is a remarkable brass, to the memory
of dame Margaret, wife of Sir William Dalsell, Knt., and daughter of
John Barnes. Esq., of Redhall, in Norfolk, who died 1563: she is represented
in a flowered petticoat, and close-bodied gown; the sleeves slashed
at the shoulders, and hanging down to the feet. Here is also the monument
of Mrs. Jane Clarke, wife of Dr. Clarke, physician at Epsom, with
an elegant inscription, by Gray. The parish register, under the date of
Oct. 24, 1740, also records the burial of Margaret Finch, who lived to the


<span class="sidenote">Queen of the
gipsies died
here, at the
age of 109.</span>


age of 109 years. She was one of the people called gipsies, and had the
title of their queen. After travelling over various parts of the kingdom,
during the greater part of a century, she settled at Norwood, whither her
great age, and the fame of her fortune-telling, attracted numerous visitors.
From a habit of sitting on the ground, with her chin resting on her knees,
the sinews at length became so contracted, that she could not rise from that
posture: after her death, they were obliged to inclose her body in a deep
square box. Her funeral was attended by two mourning coaches: a sermon
was preached upon the occasion, and a great concourse of people
attended the ceremony. Her picture adorns the sign-post of a house of
public entertainment in Norwood, called the Gipsy House. Beckenham-place,
the seat of John Cator, Esq., is partly in the parish of Bromley;
but the mansion itself is in that of Beckenham. Rear-Admiral Sir Piercy
Brett, who died in 1781, (and with his lady, lies buried in the church,) resided
here. The estate, which had long been owned by the St. Johns,
was alienated to the Cators, in 1773. The house is a handsome building,
commanding a beautiful prospect. Kent House, the ancient seat of the
Lethieullers, in Beckenham parish, is now occupied as a farm: the estate
belongs to J.J. Angerstein, Esq. Clay Hill, or the Oakery, also in this
parish, was the property of the late learned Edward King, Esq., F.R.,
and A.S. This gentleman, who was a native of Norfolk, was elected president
of the Society of Antiquaries on the decease of Dr. Milles, in 1784;
but, on the succeeding election in the year following, he was obliged to
relinquish the chair to the Earl of Leicester, after an unprecedented contest.
He was the author of various works; the principal of which are,
his "Observations on Ancient Castles;" "Morsels of Criticism," tending
to illustrate the Scriptures; and the "Monumenta Antiqua." He died
in 1806, at the age of 72.</p>

<p>[A] BECKHAMPTON. Near this place is an enormous tumulus, perhaps
the largest in England; it is called Silbury Hill, and common belief
declares it the place of sepulchre of some British king. The two antiquaries,


<span class="sidenote">Silbury
Hill.</span>


Greethead and Stukeley differ, as antiquaries frequently do, with
regard to which of the British monarchs the honor of being supposed to
lie beneath this stupendous monument should belong. The former learned
writer asserting it to be that of Prydain, and the latter calling it that of Cynneda.
Scattered over the neighbouring downs are numerous large stones
called the Grey Wethers; they bear this name from their resemblance to a
flock of sheep. Beckhampton Inn, stands at the junction of the two
great Mail roads, leading from London to Bath; the southern road passing
through Devizes and Melksham; and the northern through Calne and
Chippenham. The inn is a large brick building, but has a most desolate
appearance, according well with the character of the gloomy downs on
the margin of which it stands; yet the traveller would do well to refresh
here, as there is but little accommodation for many miles beyond.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Falmouth Mail which passes through Devizes, arrives 5.5 morning; departs 9.20 night.

<p>[B] BECKINGTON was formerly a place of much importance in the
clothing business, but the decline of that trade in the west of England
has much reduced the town. It was the birth-place of Thomas Beckington,
an English prelate, who was one of the three appointed to draw up a
code of laws in conformity with which the Wickliffites were to be proceeded
against. His book against the salique law is still in the possession
of the Lambeth library.</p>


<p>[C] BEDALE is a tolerably well built town, situated in a rich valley,
which with the surrounding country is exceedingly fertile, and both corn
and grass yield abundant crops. The town lies to the west of the Great;
Glasgow road, about two miles from Leeming Lane. Hornby Castle, the

<p>[A] BEDDGELART, is situated in a beautiful tract of meadows, at the
junction of three vales, near the conflux of the Glas Lyn, or Gwynant, or


<span class="sidenote">Nant
Colwyn.</span>


Nant hwynant, and the Colwyn, which flows through Nant Colwyn, a
vale which leads to Caernarvon. Its situation was the fittest in the world,
says Mr. Pennant, to inspire religious meditation, amid lofty mountains,
woods, and murmuring streams. The church is small, yet the loftiest in
Snowdonia. The east window consists of three narrow slips. The roof
is neat, and there yet remains some very pretty fret work. A side chapel
is supported by two neat pillars and gothic arches. This church has been
conventual, belonging to a priory of Augustines, dedicated to the Virgin.
They were probably of the class called Gilbertines, consisting of both men
and women, living under the same roof, but divided by a wall, as a piece
of ground near the church is called Dol y Llein (the meadow of the nun).
No remnant of the priory however exists. The ground on the south side
of the church seems to have been the spot whereon the buildings stood
which the monks formerly inhabited. There are two or three arched
doors on that side the church, through which probably the friars entered.
The ancient mansion-house near the church might have been the residence
of the prior. In this house is shown an old pewter mug, that will
hold upwards of two quarts; and any person able to grasp it with one
hand, while full of ale, and to drink it off at one draught, is entitled to


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
pewter
mug.</span>


the liquor gratis, and the tenant is to charge it to the lord of the manor as
part payment of his rent. Tradition says, that Llewelyn the Great came
to reside at Beddgelart during the hunting season, with his wife and
children; and one day, the family being absent, a wolf had entered the
house. On returning, his greyhound, called Ciliart, met him, wagging
his tail, but covered with blood. The prince being alarmed, ran into the
nursery, and found the cradle in which the child had lain covered
with blood. Imagining the greyhound had killed the child, he immediately
drew his sword and slew him, but on turning up the cradle,


<span class="sidenote">Tradition
of a wolf
and child.</span>


he found under it the child alive, and the wolf dead. This so affected
the prince, that he erected a tomb over his faithful dog's grave, where,
afterwards, the parish church was built, and called from this accident,
Bedd-Cilihart, or the grave of Cilihart. In the Welch annals this
region is styled the forest of Snowdon. It is a subject of great regret to
most tourists, that many of the rocks which surround Beddgelart, though
once covered with oaks, are now naked. One proprietor, however, is
raising new plantations upon his estate. Snowdonia, though once a
forest, contains now scarcely a tree. Salmon is very plentiful here, selling
sometimes as low as three-farthings a pound; the average price is
about four-pence. The best land lets at 20s. an acre; but the average of
the neighbourhood is from 2s. 6d. to 5s., with unlimited right of common
upon the mountains. In this little plain is an almost inexhaustible
turbary, or right of digging turf. There is a comfortable inn at this
place, called Beddgelart Hotel. It is marked by the emblem of the


<span class="sidenote">Guide to
the mountains.</span>


goat, with the following appropriate motto. "Patria mea Petra." My
country is a rock. The guide to the mountains is the harper of the house;
or a resident in the village. William Lloyd, the schoolmaster of this place,
was long noted as an intelligent "conductor to Snowdon, Moel Hebog,
Dinas Emrys, Llanberis pass, the lakes, waterfalls, &amp;c.; he was also a
collector of crystals, fossils, and natural curiosities found in these regions.
Dealer in superfine woollen hose, socks, gloves, &amp;c.," but in the year 1804,
he finally emerged from all sublunary avocations, to the regions beyond
the grave. Opposite to the village of Beddgelart, is Moel Hebog (the
hill of flight) which Lord Lyttelton ascended. [see Festiniog.] In a
bog near that mountain, was found in 1784, a most curious brass shield,
which was deposited with Mr. Williams, of Llanidan; its diameter was
two feet two inches, the weight four pounds; in the centre was a plain
umbo projecting above two inches; the surface was marked with twenty-seven


<span class="sidenote">Brass shield
found.</span>


smooth concentric elevated circles, and between each a depressed
space of the same breadth with the elevated parts, marked by a single row
of smooth studs. The whole shield was flat and very flexible. This
was probably Roman, for the Welsh despised every species of defensive
armour. In ascending the summit of Snowdon from this place, a
neighbouring vale is passed, which is by far the most beautiful of the
vales among these mountains. It is about six miles long, and affords
a great variety of wood, lakes, and meadows. The vale of Llanberis
is the only one which may be said to rival it; but their characters
are so different, that they cannot with propriety be compared. On the
left, about a mile and a half up the valley, is a lofty wood-clad rock,
called the fort of Ambrosius, or Merlin Ermys, a magician who was sent
for to this place from Caermarthen, by Vortigern, who was king of Britain
from 449 to 466. Upon its summit is a level piece of ground, and
the remains of a square fort; and upon the west side, facing Beddgelart,
there are traces of a long wall. It stands detached from other rocks, and
at a distance appears in the form of a man's hat. Adjoining is a stony


<span class="sidenote">Groves of
the magicians.</span>


tract called the cells or groves of the magicians. In the next field, a
number of large stones are called the tombs of the magicians. It was to
this place that Vortigern retired, when he found himself despised by his
subjects, and unable to contend longer with the treacherous Saxons, whom
he had introduced into his kingdom. It is probable that this insular rock
afforded him a temporary residence till he removed to his final retreat in
Nant Gwrtheyrn, or Vortigern's Valley. Speed says, probably without
truth, that Vortigern married his own child by Rowena, daughter of Hengist,
the Saxon prince, and had by her one son. There is a tradition, that
Madog, the son of prince Owen Gwynedd, resided in this vale for some
time before he left his country for America. The entrance from Beddgelart,
is but the breadth of a narrow rugged road, close by the river's side, in
which there is nothing inviting; but passing on, the traveller advances
upon enchanted ground, where he finds extensive meadows, expanding at
every turn of rock, smooth as a bowling green; beautiful lakes and meandering
rivers, abounding in fish; mountains towering one above the
other in succession, while to the left, Snowdon overtops them all, seeming


<span class="sidenote">Snowdon.</span>


like another Atlas, to support the firmament. Mr. Pennant, says he continued
his walk along a narrow path above the lake, as far as the extremity;
then descending, reached the opposite side, in order to encounter a
third ascent, as arduous as the preceding. This brought him into the
horrible crater immediately beneath the great precipice of Wyddfa; its
situation is dreadful, surrounded by more than three parts of a circle, with
the most horrible precipices of the highest peak of Snowdon. The strange
break, called the pass of the Arrows, was probably a station for the hunters
to watch the wandering of the deer. The margin of Ffynmon-las here
appeared to be shallow and gravelly, the waters had a greenish cast, but
what is very singular, the rocks reflected into them seemed varied with
stripes of the richest colours, like the most beautiful lute-strings, and


<span class="sidenote">The pass
of the Arrows.</span>


changed almost to infinity. Here he observed the wheat-ear, a small and
seemingly tender bird, and yet almost the only small one, or indeed the
only one, (except the rock-ouzel) that frequents these heights; the reason
is evidently the want of food. The mountainous tract near Snowdon,
scarcely yields any corn; the produce is cattle and sheep, which during
summer they keep very high in the mountains, followed by their owners
with their families, who reside during that season in their Havod-dai, or
summer dwelling, or dairy houses, as the farmers in the Swiss Alps do in
their Sennes. These houses consist of a long low room, with a hole at one
end to let out the smoke, from the fire which is made beneath. Their furniture
is very simple, stones are the substitutes for stools, and the beds are
of hay, ranged along the sides: they manufacture their own clothes and dye
them with plants, collected from the rocks. During summer, the men pass


<span class="sidenote">The summer
habits of
the mountaineers.</span>


their time in harvest work, or tending their herds; the women in milking,
or making butter and cheese of the milk for their own consumption. The
diet of these mountaineers is very plain, consisting of butter, cheese and
oat bread; their drink is whey, not but that they have their reserve of a
few bottles of very strong beer, by way of cordial, in sickness. They are
people of good understanding, wary, and circumspect; usually tall, thin,
and of strong constitutions, from their way of living. Towards winter,
they descend to their old dwelling, where they lead, during that season, a
vacant life, in carding, spinning, knitting, &amp;c. The height of Snowdon is
3571 feet.</p>

<p>[A] BEDFORDSHIRE. This county, before the Roman invasion, was
part of the district inhabited by a race of people whom the invaders denominated
Cassii. Afterwards, in A.D. 310, it was a third part of the division
named Flavia C&aelig;sariensis. After that, it was attached to the kingdom
of Mercia. In 827 it became subject to the West Saxons. It was
first called Bedfordshire in the reign of Alfred the Great, probably from
Bedan Forda: i.e. The Fortress on the Ford; there being fortifications
on the borders of the river Ouse. It is an inland county, bounded on the
north by Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire; west by Buckinghamshire;


<span class="sidenote">An inland
county.</span>


south by Bucks and Herts; and east by Herts and Cambridgeshire.
Its form approaches an irregular parallelogram, with many deep and
almost isolated indentations. The extent is about 36 miles in the greatest
length, and the greatest breadth about 22 miles; it contains 465 square
miles; circumference about 95 miles. It is divided into 9 hundreds, 125
parishes, 10 market towns, 58 vicarages, 550 villages, having a total population
of 95,383 inhabitants. It belongs to the Norfolk circuit, and is
in the diocese of Lincoln; subject to an archdeaconal jurisdiction, being
divided into six deaneries. The climate is deemed mild and genial. The
prevailing winds south westerly; the north east winds being regarded as
indicating a cold summer and a severe winter. The soil is of an exceedingly

mixed and varied character; but much the greatest portion is of a
clayey nature, particularly in parts north of Bedford. The south districts
are chalky. A slip extending diagonally from Woburn to near Biggleswade
is a mixed sand; an almost equal portion from the vicinity of Biggleswade
to the neighbourhood of Bedford, partakes of a rich gravelly
soil; part of which, near the town of Biggleswade and village of Sandy,
is successfully cultivated for the production of garden vegetables to a considerable


<span class="sidenote">Value of

extent. So peculiarly is that soil adapted for such produce, that
it is in some instances let for more than &pound;14. per acre; and generally
from &pound;4. to &pound;9. may be considered as a fair rent for that luxuriant soil.
There can be no standard or real average as to the value of land; as the
value, like the soil itself, is exceedingly variable. Rivers.&mdash;The Ouse and
the Ivel are the chief; both of which abound with fish of various kinds.
The Ouse is remarkable for very great and sudden inundations. The
Grand Junction Canal skirts this county at Leighton Buzzard. The
natural produce consists chiefly in corn, garden vegetables, cheese and
butter. There is a little ironstone, limestone, and a few extraneous fossils.
There are several mineral springs, but none of any celebrity. The
principal landed proprietor is the Duke of Bedford. His Grace possesses
estates in about 25 parishes; under the auspices of whom and of his
illustrious brother, the county is indebted for immense agricultural improvements.</p>

<p>[A] BEDFORD. This is an ancient corporation, the earliest charter of
which is dated in 1160. It is governed by a mayor, recorder, aldermen,
two chamberlains, and thirteen common councilmen. Whoever may have
been a mayor is always afterwards reputed as an alderman. The mayor
and bailiffs are chosen annually out of the freemen. As early as the year


<span class="sidenote">Very ancient
corporation.</span>


1295, it sent two members to parliament. The Duke of Bedford takes
his title from this town, which first gave title of duke to the victorious
prince John Plantagenet, Regent of France, during the minority of his
nephew, Henry VI. as it did in the reign of Edward IV. first to John
Nevil, Marquis of Montacute, and then to the king's third son, George
Plantagenet; but he dying an infant, the title lay vacant till Henry VII.
created his uncle, Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, who also died without
issue; and thus far the title was enjoyed by the first possessor only of
each family. But King Edward VI. making John, Lord Russel, Earl of
Bedford, the dignity has ever since been in that illustrious house, with an
advancement of it to the title of Duke, by King William III. The history


<span class="sidenote">Origin of
the Bedford
family.</span>


of the noble family of Russell is curious and interesting. They appear to
have originated in Dorsetshire, and owe their greatness to an accident on
that coast. In the reign of Henry VII., Philip, Archduke of Austria,
being bound for Spain, the heiress of which kingdom he had married, was
obliged by a storm to put on shore at Weymouth, where he was received
by Sir Thomas Frenchard, of Wolverton, Knt., who, till he could inform
the court of the event, sent for his neighbour Mr. John Russell, then
lately returned from his travels, to entertain his illustrious guests. The
Archduke was so pleased with his conversation, that he recommended him
to the king of England, who soon advanced him to several honourable
posts, and his son Henry VIII. created him Baron Russell of Cheneys,
in the county of Bucks, which estate he afterwards acquired by marriage.
He was made by Henry VIII. lord warden of the stannaries, and
lord admiral of England and Ireland, knight of the garter, and lord
privy seal. In the reign of Edward VI. he was lord high steward for
the coronation, and had a grant of Woburn Abbey, and was in the 3rd
of Edward VI. 1549, created earl of Bedford. He had the honour to
conduct over to England, Philip of Spain, grandson to the prince who first
brought him to court and advancement. He died 1554, and was succeeded
by his son Francis, who died in 1585, and was buried at Cheneys,
as were most of his descendants. His son Francis being killed a day or
two before his father's death, by the Scotch in the marches, his son Edward
succeeded his grandfather, and died 1627; he was succeeded by his
cousin Francis, son of his uncle William, lord Russell, of Thornhaugh,
lord deputy of Ireland, in the reign of Elizabeth. This Francis was the
first projector of the draining of the great level of the fens, called after


<span class="sidenote">Bedford
Level.</span>


him, Bedford Level, and dying 1641, was succeeded by his eldest son William,
who after having several times joined both parties during the civil
war, at last adhered to the royal cause, and suffered a severe loss in the
death of his only son by the very family whom he had supported; to
compensate for which he was created by King William, Marquis of Tavistock,
and Duke of Bedford, and dying in 1700, was succeeded by his
grandson Wriothesley. He, in 1711, by his son and namesake, and he
1732, by his brother John, who, dying in 1771, was succeeded by his
grandson Francis, the late duke, who died rather suddenly, of an illness
occasioned by a rupture, on the 2nd of March, 1802, in the 37th year of
his age. His brother, Lord John Russell, succeeded him in his title and
estates. This nobleman, so suddenly and unexpectedly raised to ducal
honours, was born on the sixth of July, 1766; and, on the 21st of March,
1786, before he had completed his twentieth year, he married at Brussels,
Georgiana Elizabeth, the second daughter of Viscount Torrington.
This lady died on the 11th of October, 1801; leaving issue, Francis,
born May 10, 1788; George William, born May 8, 1790; and John,
born August 19, 1792. Shortly after his accession to the title, his grace
married a second time, Georgiana, the fifth daughter of the duke of
Gordon, by whom he had several children. After the death of
Mr. Pitt, when Mr. Fox and his friends succeeded to power, his grace
was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; a post which, without distinguishing
himself as a party man, he filled to the entire and general
satisfaction of the public. When Henry II. granted a charter to the burgesses


<span class="sidenote">First charter
granted
by Henry II.</span>


of the town of Bedford, he rendered it subject to the payment of
&pound;40. per annum, as a fee-farm rent to the crown. Their mercantile guild
and ancient privileges were confirmed by the succeeding monarch, who
also granted new privileges and immunities similar to those enjoyed by
the burgesses of Oxford. Richard II. granted still more extended privileges,
and among others a view of Frankpledge within the borough. In
this monarch's charter the corporation are styled the mayor, bailiffs, and
burgesses. In the reign of Edward I. the liberties of the town were seized
by that monarch, the bailiffs having neglected to discharge the fee-farm
rent. In the reign of Henry VI. the town being much decayed, many
houses gone to ruin, and the trade of it brought low, and the usual issues
discontinued, the inhabitants petitioned the king to shew them his grace:
accordingly he granted that the yearly rent should be remitted in part for
a time. In the reign of Henry VII. it was permanently reduced, through
the interposition of Sir Reginald Bray, then Prime Minister, to &pound;20. per
annum, and afterwards to &pound;16. 5s. 8d. which rent is now payable to their
successors. The last renewal of the charter of incorporation was in the
reign of King James II. in whose time the mayor and aldermen were removed
from their respective offices, by royal mandate, for neglecting to
elect two burgesses to serve in parliament. The members were in consequence
chosen by his Majesty's ministers. The right of election was
determined in 1690, to be in the burgesses, freemen, and inhabitant
householders not receiving alms. The number of voters is nearly 500.
Bedford is a place of great antiquity, and is supposed by some writers to
have been the Lactidorum of Antoninus; but Camden objects to this, on
the ground that the town is not situated on any Roman road, neither have
any Roman coins been found there. Its situation is upon the Ouse, by
which it is divided into two parts, in the direction of east and west. This
circumstance enables it to carry on a considerable trade with Lynn. In
the Saxons' time, Bedford was a place of considerable consequence: as


<span class="sidenote">King Offa
buried here.</span>


appears from its having been chosen by Offa, the powerful King of the
Mercians, for his burial place. His bones were interred in a small chapel,
which being situated on the brink of the river Ouse, was afterwards undermined
and swept away by the floods, during an inundation. Bedford,
as has been already stated, was also famous for a victory gained in the
year 572, by Cuthwlf, the Saxon king, over the Britons. The Danes once
destroyed this town; but Edward the Elder repaired it, and united the
town on the south side of the river, called Mikesgate, to Bedford, on the
north side of it; since which they have both gone by this name. After
the conquest, Pain de Beauchamp, the third Baron of Bedford, built a
castle here, encompassed with a mighty rampart of earth, and a high wall,
the whole so strong that King Stephen, who besieged and took it in his
war with the Empress Maud, was glad to grant the garrison honourable
terms. In the barons' wars it was again besieged, and for want of relief,
taken by King John's forces under Fulco de Brent, to whom the King
gave it for a reward; but for his subsequent behaviour he took it from
him, and caused it to be demolished, though it was not quite level till the
reign of Henry III. The celebrated John Bunyan, whom we shall notice


<span class="sidenote">John Bunyan.</span>


hereafter, was ordained co-pastor of the congregation of St. Peter's, in
1671, and continued in that situation until he died in 1688. The chair in
which he used to sit is still preserved as a relic in the vestry of the chapel.
As early as the year 1745, the Moravians, or society of Unitas Fratrum,
had an establishment at Bedford, where they built a neat chapel in 1750.
Of late years, however, the number of these recluse and inoffensive
sectaries has considerably declined; and the house adjoining to the
chapel, which was formerly appropriated to the brethren and the sisters
of the society, has been converted into a school. In the year 1556, Sir


<span class="sidenote">Noble charity,
founded by
Sir William
Harper.</span>


William Harper founded a free school in Bedford, for the instruction of
children of the town in grammar and good manners. The school-house
was rebuilt in 1767, when a statue of the founder was placed in the front,
with a latin inscription beneath, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Behold, Traveller, the Bodily Resemblance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of Sir William Harper, Knight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Of this School,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thus spacious and Adorned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">The Munificent Founder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">The Picture of His Mind,<br />
Is Dedicated in the Table of Benefactions."</span>
</p>

<p>The warden and fellows of New College, Oxford, are visitors of this
school, and have the appointment of the masters and ushers. The master's
salary is &pound;260. with coals and candles; that of the second master is
&pound;160., with the same allowance of fire and candle. The writing-master
has a salary of &pound;80. per annum. Sir William Harper, for the support of
this excellent institution, conveyed to the corporation thirteen acres and
one rood of land, lying in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, which he
had purchased for the sum of &pound;180.; he also conveyed his late dwelling-house,
&amp;c., at Bedford. The revenues of these estates were also to be
applied towards apportioning maidens of the town on their entrance into
the marriage estate. In the year 1660, the corporation leased the whole
of the lands in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn, for the term of 41
years, at the yearly rent of &pound;99. In the year 1684, a reversionary


<span class="sidenote">Its revenues.</span>


lease was granted for the further term of 51 years, at the improved rent of
&pound;150. In consequence of granting these leases, a great number of houses
were built, and the following streets covered the above-mentioned thirteen
acres of meadow land:&mdash;Bedford-street, Bedford-row, Bedford-court,
Princes-street, Theobald's-road, North-street, East-street, Lamb's Conduit-street,
Queen-street, Eagle-street, Boswell-court, Queen-street, Harper-street,
Richbell-court, Hand-court, Gray's Inn-passage, Three Cup-yard,
&amp;c. The annual rent of these buildings is now considerably
increased, and it is expected that in a few years it will amount to upwards
of &pound;30,000. This extraordinary increase of revenue occasioned the
trustees to apply to parliament for two several acts to regulate its disposal,
and to extend the objects of the charity. By the priorism contained in
these acts of parliament, the maintenance of the master and usher of the
grammar-school, and the maintenance of a master, and two ushers to the
English school, is provided. Three exhibitions of &pound;40. per annum, are
given to scholars from the free school, either at Oxford or Cambridge,
during the space of six years. The sum of &pound;800. per annum is appropriated
for marriage portions, to be given by lot in sums of &pound;20. each, to
forty poor maidens of Bedford, of good fame and reputation, not under
sixteen years of age, and not exceeding fifty. They are not to marry
within two months after receiving the marriage portion, otherwise to forfeit
it. The men to whom they are to be married must not be vagrants
or persons of bad fame or reputation. A yearly sum of &pound;3,000. per
annum is also appropriated by the last act, for the maintenance of twenty-six
boys in an hospital or school of industry, and &pound;700. to be laid out
in apprentice fees for fifteen poor boys and five girls, to be chosen by lot.
The trustees have likewise been enabled to build alms-houses for


<span class="sidenote">Alms-houses.</span>


a number of poor men and women. The weekly allowance to each is
3s., and 40s. annually for clothing. If a poor man and his wife live together,
they are allowed to the amount of 5s. per week. One hundred
pounds per annum is appropriated to be given in sums of &pound;5. each, to
twenty poor girls upon their going out to service. The residue of the
income is to be laid out in buildings, and in endowing more alms-houses,
or building cottages to be let at a low rent to the poor. Here are also a
house of industry, and an infirmary, which are well supported. Lace-making
employs a great number of the lower classes, both in the town and county
of Bedford. The lace is chiefly made by women; and children at the


<span class="sidenote">Lace-making,<br />
the chief trade.</span>


early age of four years are set down to it. On certain days, the persons
appointed by the dealers collect the lace of the different villages, and convey
it to the London market. A strong stone bridge connects the
northern and southern parts of the town. "This bridge," says Grose, "is
one hundred and sixteen yards in length, four and a half broad, and has
a parapet three feet and a half high; this, it is said, was erected in the
reign of Queen Mary, out of the ruins of St. Dunstan's church, which
stood on the south side of the bridge. It has seven arches, and near the
centre were two gate-houses; that on the north, being used for a prison,
and that on the south served as a store-house for the arms and ammunition
of the troops quartered here. These gate-houses were taken down
in the year 1765, and six lamps set up on posts at proper distances."
The town-hall, or sessions-house, in which the assizes for the county are
holden, is situated in an area before St. Paul's church. It was erected in
the year 1753, and is a capacious and handsome structure.</p>

<p>[A] BEDWIN was a market-town, and supposed by Stukeley to have
been the Leucomagus of the Romans; it certainly was a chief city of the
Saxons, who built a castle there. It was a borough by prescription, sending
two members to parliament, and is governed by a portreeve, and exercises
many of its original rights, although considerably reduced in
population. The church, a cruciform building of flints, with a central
tower, is ancient and curious in itself, and for the monuments which it
contains. The obtusely pointed arches of the nave, ornamented with
zig-zag and billetted mouldings, rest on capitals, richly adorned with
flowers, grotesque heads, and other figures. In the south transept are
two tombs, which commemorate Adam and Roger de Stocre, Lords, according
to Leland, of "Stoke Haulle thereby." The chancel contains
the noble altar monument of Sir John Seymour, of Wolphall, father of
the Protector, Somerset, and other distinguished persons. Near this
tomb are two brass plates, on one of which is the figure of a lady, with
her hands folded, and the inscription&mdash;"Julia Seymour;" the other commemorates


<span class="sidenote">Monument
of Julia Seymour,
sister to Lady
Jane Grey.</span>


a son of Sir John Seymour. The manor of Bedwin, which
once belonged to Gilbert, Earl of Clare, husband of Anna d'Acres, was
purchased by the late Earl of Aylesbury. This place gave birth, in 1621,
to Dr. Thomas Willis, a learned physician, who wrote several works on
his art, was appointed physician in ordinary to Charles II., and died of
pleurisy in 1675. On Castle-hill is an entrenchment, in area two acres,
with some foundations, supposed to be those of a castle, founded by the
Saxons. Chisbury Castle is an entrenchment more than fifteen acres in
extent, supposed to have been begun by the Britons, and sometime occupied
by the Romans. The neighbouring village of Little Bedwin has a
church built of flints, in the Anglo-Norman style of architecture, with a
nave, aisles, chancel, and tower.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Market</i>, formerly Tuesday (disused).&mdash;<i>Fairs</i>, April 23, and July 26, for horses, cows, and

<p>[B] BEERALSTON. This place once had the privilege of sending two
members to parliament. It is chiefly inhabited by labourers employed in
agriculture and mining. The borough was under the influence of the Earl
of Beverley. The right of election was vested in those who had land in
the borough, and paid three-pence acknowledgment to the Lord of the
Manor, who varied the number of electors at his pleasure, by granting


<span class="sidenote">Electioneering
abuses.</span>


burgage-tenures, which were generally resigned when the election was concluded,
to as many of his partisans as were requisite. The portreeve,
chosen annually in the Lord's court, was the returning-officer. The first
members were returned in the twenty-seventh of Elizabeth. Risdon
mentions that Beare was bestowed by William the Conqueror on a family
descended from the house of Alencon in France, and that it still continues
its name under the corruption of Bere-Alson. In the reign of Henry II.,
Henry Ferrers had a castle here, which came to the possession of his descendant
Martin Ferrers, the last of the house, in the time of Edward III.
The manor then came to the Champernounes, and passed respectively
through the families of Willoughby, Mountjoy, Maynard, and Stamford,
to the present possessor, the Duke of Northumberland. In this place are
several lead-mines, now of inconsiderable value, though sometimes impregnated
with silver; but in the reign of Edward I., it is said, that in
the space of three years 1,600 pounds weight of silver was obtained.
Since that time no considerable quantity has ever been procured.</p>

<p>[A] BERE FERRIS. This parish is situated south by west from Tavistock.
Here, observes Risdon, "lieth Ley, the ancient possession of a
family so called, whence the name tooke that honor; for from hence Sir
James Ley, Knt., Lord Chief Justice of England, and High Treasurer,
created afterwards Earle of Marlborough, descended; a lawgiver in the
chief place of justice, and a preserver of venerable antiquity, whose noble
thoughts were so fixed on virtue, and his discourses embellished with
wisdome, and his heart with integrity, that his words did never bite, nor
his actions wrong any man, to give him just cause of complaynt."


<span class="sidenote">A honest

Amongst several ancient monuments in Bere-Ferris Church, is one under
an arched recess, of a cross-legged knight half inclined on his right side,
with his right hand on his sword; and another of a knight and his lady,
under a richly ornamented arch in the chancel. Among the figures
painted on the east window is that of William Ferrers, who was probably
the builder of this fabric, as he is represented kneeling, and holding the
model of a church in his hand.</p>



<p>[B] BERE REGIS is situated in the Blandford division of the county.
Drs. Stukeley and Coker conjecture that this place was the site of a
Roman station; an opinion which is confirmed by a large entrenchment
upon Woodbury Hill, about half a mile north-east of the parish. The
area of this place, which contains about ten acres, is surrounded by triple
ramparts, that in some places are high and deep. On the summit, which
commands a very extensive prospect, a fair is annually holden. This fair
begins on the Nativity of the Virgin, and continues through the five following
days: though of late years it has much decreased; it was once the
most considerable in the west of England. Queen Elfrida, to whom the
manor belonged, is said to have retired to her seat in this place, after the


<span class="sidenote">The residence
of Queen
Elfrida.</span>


murder of her son-in-law, Edward the Martyr. King John also appears
to have made it his residence. In the reign of Henry III. the manor was
bestowed on Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester; but, as a consequence
attending his rebellion, it was taken from him, and granted to the King's
brother, Edmund. Edmund gave a moiety of it to the Abbess of Tarent,
who, in the reign of Edward I. claimed for her manor of Bere a fair, a
market, a free-warren, and the whole forest of Bere. Her moiety of these
was granted her. At the dissolution, Henry VIII., for the sum of
&pound;680. 16s. 8d. granted the manor to Robert Turberville, to whose ancestors
the other moiety had belonged for ages. The mansion of the
Turbervilles still remains: it is an ancient irregular structure, built with
stone, and its windows contain various quarterings of the Turberville family
and its alliances. Bere Regis, though it does not appear ever to
have been represented in parliament, was incorporated in the time of
Edward I. Its market is ancient, as appears from King John's having
confirmed it to the inhabitants. The church is a large and handsome
structure, and contains numerous monuments of the Turberville and other
families. The town of Bere Regis has suffered twice by fire: once in
1634, and again in 1788. After the latter fire the inhabitants found
shelter in the booths erected for the fair. The most distinguished natives
of the place have been James Turberville, Bishop of Exeter, and John
Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>[A] BEES, (ST.) This ancient village is situated in the Ward of Allerdale,
west by north from Egremont. It is understood to have derived its name
and origin from a religious house, which was founded here about the year
650, by St. Bega, an Irish nun of great sanctity. On the death of Bega,


<span class="sidenote">Early history.</span>


a church was erected in honour of her virtues; but both these establishments
having been destroyed by the Danes, William, son of Ranulph de
Meschines, replaced them by a new foundation of Benedictine monks, and
made it a cell to the Abbey of St. Mary at York: in the time of Henry I.
The manor was granted after the dissolution to Sir Thomas Chaloner, by
Edward VI. in the last year of his reign. It next became the property
of a family named Wyberg, from whom, under a fore-closed mortgage,
it passed to an ancestor of the Earl of Lonsdale, about the year 1663.
St. Bees church, which was erected about the time of Henry I., had the
form of a cross, and great part of it is yet standing. The east-end is
unroofed, and in ruins: the nave, however, is fitted up as the parish
church, and the cross aisle is used as a place of sepulchre. The ancient
chancel has narrow lancet windows, ornamented with double mouldings,
and pilasters, with rich capitals. At the east end are niches,
of a singular form, with pointed arches, supported on well proportioned
pillars, having capitals adorned with rich engravings. The whole edifice
is of red free-stone. A free grammar school was founded in the village of
St. Bees by Archbishop Girandal, under a charter from Queen Elizabeth,
towards the close of the sixteenth century. This prelate was born in the
neighbouring village of Helsingham, in the year 1519. He was educated
at Cambridge, where he obtained a fellowship at Pembroke Hall. Being
attached to the principles of the Reformation, Bishop Ridley made him
his chaplain, and precentor of St. Pauls. He was also appointed chaplain
to the King, and prebendary of Westminster; but on the accession of
Mary he retired to Germany, and settled at Strasburgh. When Elizabeth
ascended the throne he returned home, and was employed in revising the
Litany. In 1559 he was chosen master of Pembroke Hall, and the same


<span class="sidenote">Archbishop

year preferred to the see of London, from whence, in 1570 he was translated
to York, and in 1575 to Canterbury. Two years afterwards he was
suspended from his archiepiscopal functions, for refusing to obey the
Queen's order to suppress prophecyings, or the associations of the clergy
to expound the Scriptures. His sequestration was taken off, though he
never completely recovered the royal favour. He died at Croydon, 1583.
He contributed to Fox's acts and monuments. James I. afterwards increased
the endowments, which have been since augmented by divers
benefactors. Several scholars of great eminence have received the
rudiments of education in this seminary. It is remarkable, however,
that, till a few years ago, the school had not undergone any material
change since its foundation. Occasional repairs were indeed found absolutely
necessary for the support of the buildings, but no improvement
seems ever to have been attempted. Through the munificence of the
Earl of Lonsdale this long respected seminary has been put into complete
order, and made more suitable to the purpose intended by the pious
founder than it had been at any time since its erection. Exclusive of
what has been done at the spacious school-room, the library is rendered
more commodious. The master's house, which adjoins the school, has
been enlarged, some parts of it rebuilt, a good garden well walled round,
and the whole made a very comfortable and eligible residence.</p>

<p>[A] BEESTON. Near this village are the remains of a castle, once deemed
impregnable; it is situated on a sandstone rock, 366 feet in perpendicular
height. So strong was this fortress considered, that it became a proverb
in the neighbourhood to say, "It is as strong as Beeston Castle." The
area contains five acres, and was rendered unapproachable by means of a
very wide ditch. In the reign of Charles I. it underwent a lengthened
siege, or rather blockade, for all communications were cut off with the
neighbourhood for a long term; at last it was compelled to surrender,
and the parliament ordered it to be dismantled. During the period of the
threatened invasion of the French, in 1803, this castle was fixed upon by
the lieutenancy of the county, as the site for a signal station and beacon.
The ancient and craggy walls are beautifully mantled over with a luxuriant


<span class="sidenote">Castle on a
rock.</span>


covering of ivy, and the base of the hill abounds with several
varieties of rare plants. The well of the castle is nearly 300 feet deep,
and the peasantry firmly believe that it contains a vast store of riches,
which have been thrown into it during the civil wars. A mineral spring
was discovered here a few years ago. The inhabitants of Chester
consider it a favourite holiday indulgence to visit this castle in a pleasure
excursion; and by application to an old woman in the village, who may be


<span class="sidenote">A favourite
place of
resort.</span>


considered the female warden of the place, travellers can be conducted to
the summit of the building. The views from the ramparts are beautiful,
extending over the whole Vale Royal of Cheshire, to the estuaries of the
rivers Mersey and Dee: that side of the hill which forms a precipice rises
perpendicularly 160 feet from the base of the elevation, and upon looking
down from the high pinnacle of the castle wall, it is sufficient to call to
remembrance the sublime poetic effusion of our immortal bard:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">

<p>[B] BEETHOM. This mountainous and highly interesting parish is
situated in the Kendal Ward, at the south-western extremity of the
county of Westmoreland, on both sides of estuaries of the river Kent,
which is navigable for small craft as far as the hamlet of Storch, and
comprises the chapelries of Witherslack, and the townships of Beetham,
Farleton, Haverbrack, and Methop, with Ulpha. The parish church is
dedicated to St. Michael, the patron saint of mountainous and hilly
parishes: it is a neat building, situated in a fine vale, or holm ground,
commanding the richest variety of wood, water, and rocky scenery. Here
are two fine old monuments to the memory of Thomas de Beetham and
his lady, who lived in the reign of Richard III. Here was anciently a
chapel, dedicated to St. John, and near it, in a garden, a considerable
number of human bones were dug up; it was situated about forty yards
from the present school-house. Some few years since a mole cast up an
amber bead, and with it an oval piece of silver, about the size of a shilling;
it was perforated through the middle, and on one side was an impression
of the crucifixion, with the letters J.N.R.J.; on the right of which was a
crescent, and on the left a rising sun; at the bottom, the Virgin Mary, in
a weeping attitude: on the reverse, a lamb, with a standard, and St.
Andrews' cross. The parsonage, or rectory-house, which stood on the
north-east corner of the churchyard, was formerly called the college of St.
Mary's. The Hilton family had also a handsome house near this spot,
which was enlarged and improved by George Hilton, an eccentric squire,


<span class="sidenote">George Hilton,
an eccentric
character.</span>


and well known character in this neighbourhood about the commencement
of the last century. This George Hilton was a Roman Catholic, and
joined the Scotch rebels in 1715, upon whose defeat he made his escape,
but was pardoned by the act of grace the year following, and afterwards
retired to a house which he built at the south end of Beethom Park. Mr.
Hutton, the historian of this place, says, "that he discovered a diary, in
an old chest, which was kept by this gentleman, taken by himself every
night, but which was afterwards lost. 'On Sunday, (says he in one
place,) I vowed to abstain from three things during the ensuing week
(Lent), viz. women, eating of flesh, and drinking of wine; but, alas!
the frailty of good resolutions. I broke them all! Conversed with
a woman&mdash;was tempted to eat the wing of a fowl&mdash;and got drunk at
Milnthorp.'" Of this parish the Rev. William Hutton was vicar, who
wrote a folio book of collections for its history, which he deposited
in the vestry for the information of posterity, with blank pages to
be filled up as materials should occur. He was an amiable man, and
an indefatigable antiquarian. The old manor house, called the Hall of
Beethom, was a fine old castellated mansion, but now unfortunately in
ruins. One large apartment in this castle is still called the hall, and according

<span class="sidenote">The Hall.</span>

to the laudable practice of ancient hospitality, was devoted to the
purpose of entertaining the friends and dependants of the family: and
hence came the proverb&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"'Tis merry in the hall<br />
When beards wag all."
</p>

<p>The remains of a room, formerly used as a chapel, still exist; and the
ruins of this fine mansion are of considerable extent. The ruins of another
hall in this parish are also to be seen in Cappleside Demesne,
consisting of a front and two wings, comprising an extent of 117 feet of
frontage. Also an ancient tower, now in ruins, called Helslack Tower:
and another tower, called Arnside Tower; equally neglected. These
towers seem to have been intended to guard the Bay of Morecambe, as
similar buildings are erected on the opposite side of the river. A grammar
school was founded here in 1663, and rebuilt in 1827. It has an endowment
of about &pound;40. a year, arising out of lands bequeathed for the instruction
of fifty poor boys.</p>

<p>[A] BELCHAMP, or Belchamp Wallers, in the hundred of Hinckford,
lies north-east by north from Castle Headingham. The church, dedicated
to the Virgin Mary, is lofty and neat, and contains an orchestra,
with a fine toned organ. Here is a capacious vault which belongs to the
Raymond family; and an elegant marble monument dedicated to them in
the chancel. Mrs. Raymond has established in this village a Sunday


<span class="sidenote">Belchamp
Hall.</span>


school for fifty children belonging to the poor. Belchamp Hall, in this
parish, is the residence of the Raymond's, one of whose ancestors came
into England with the Conqueror, and whose family have resided in this
neighbourhood upwards of two centuries. The house is a substantial and
commodious building, whose principal or south-eastern front is for the
most part composed of foreign bricks. It is situated on a pleasant lawn,
sloping gradually to a small river, within 200 yards of the front. A spacious
and extensive terrace, skirted with lofty trees, at the end of which is
an ancient building, ornamented with painted glass, lies to the south. At
the other end is a lofty mount, with another ornamental building on its
summit. This mansion contains an interesting collection of pictures by
some of the most esteemed masters; among them are the following:&mdash;The
Wise Men's Offering, an altar-piece; Albert Durer. This picture,
with a large gun, some pistols, and powder flasks, inlaid with gold and
ivory, were presented to the Raymonds, by Sir William Harris, a sea-officer,
who took them, with other property, on the defeat of the Spanish
Armada, in 1588. A three-quarter portrait of Sir Hugh Middleton, Bart.,
in whose public spirit the New river originated, and another of his wife,
are both by Cornelius Jansen. Goldingham Hall, in the parish of
Bulmer, adjoining Belchamp, was the residence of Sir Hugh.</p>



<p>[B] BELFORD is a little market town pleasantly situated on the side of a
hill about two miles from the river Lear, and being a post-town, and on
the great north road, has several good inns. The buildings in general are
neat, and the church is a handsome structure, erected in 1700. Near this
place on a rising ground, are the ruins of an ancient chapel, surrounded
by several tall oaks; and at a little distance, are the remains of a Danish
camp, apparently of great strength, surrounded by a deep ditch. The
annual races formerly run at Beadnall, now take place at this town.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Market</i>, Tuesday&mdash;<i>Fairs</i>, Tuesday before Whit-Sunday, and August 23, for black cattle,

<p>[C] BELLEAU. At this place, which takes it name from the excellent
springs that issue from the chalk hills in the neighbourhood, are the ruins
of what is called the Abbey. These consist of part of a turret, and two


<span class="sidenote">Abbey
Ruins.</span>


gateways, which convey an idea of its being a place of considerable importance.
The walls are covered with ivy, and overhung with lofty ash
trees. After the civil war, this place was granted to the eccentric Sir
Harry Vane, who used to amuse himself on Sundays in assembling here
his country neighbours, to whom he addressed his pious discourses.
The church of Belleau is said, by Gough, to have been attached to the
neighbouring monastery of Ailby; but neither Tanner nor the Monasticon
mention such a religious house.</p>

<p>[A] BELLINGHAM, lies N. N W. from Hexham. It gave name to an
ancient family, who were seated here in 1378. Some ruins of their castle
still remain. The chapel, dedicated to St. Cuthbert, is roofed with stone
arches in rib-work: there are many gravestones in its floor, sculptured
with swords, and other warlike emblems. Nearly opposite, on the south
side of the North Tyne, is Heslieside, the seat of the Charlton family,
since the time of Edward the Sixth. The old mansion-house, built after
the manner of Lowther Hall, in Westmoreland, was burnt down about
eighty years ago, and then rebuilt. The present edifice stands on a gentle
eminence: the grounds are well wooded, and diversified with fine sheep-walks;
and the gardens and fruit walls are very productive. Five miles
above this place is Falstone chapel; and about seven miles further up is
Keelder Castle, formerly the residence of a famous border chieftain, but
at present a shooting-box of the Duke of Northumberland. The moors
here are scattered over with cairns, tumuli, and Druidical monuments.
Of Tarset Hall, about two miles above Heslieside, only some slight remains
are visible. Of Chipchase Castle, the old tower still remains. Its


<span class="sidenote">Chipchase
Castle.</span>


roof is built on corbels, and it has openings through which to throw down
stones or scalding water upon an enemy. The tattered fragments of
Gothic painting on the walls, are exceedingly curious. Soon after it came
to the family, (its present owners,) the mansion was thoroughly repaired,
and much improved; the chapel on the lawn was rebuilt, the gardens
made, and the grounds covered with extensive plantations. This delightful
residence is surrounded with scenery of the richest and most enchanting
kind. The rooms in it are fitted up in a splendid style, and ornamented
with several excellent paintings. A bridge was erected over the
Burn at the east end of the town in 1826.</p>

<p>[B] BELPER, or Belpar, anciently Beaupoire, is situated on the banks
of the Derwent, in the hundred of Appletree. It is a chapelry of Duffield;
and, though formerly an inconsiderable village, its population now exceeds,
with the exception of Derby, every other town in the county. The great
increase of population began from three large cotton mills of Messrs. Strutts,
the first of which was erected in 1776. Two of them yet remain; but
the third was destroyed by fire early in the year 1803. The largest of
these mills is 200 feet long, 300 feet wide, and six stories high: it is considered


<span class="sidenote">Manufactories.</span>


fire proof, as the floor is built on brick arches, and paved with
brick. The two water-wheels, which are employed in the machinery in
this building, are remarkable for magnitude and singularity of construction;
one of them being 40 feet long, and 18 in diameter; and the other
48 feet long, and 12 feet in diameter. As timber could not be procured
large enough to form the axles of these wheels in the common manner,
they are constructed circularly and hollow, of a number of pieces, and
hooped in the manner of a cask. One of the shafts is six feet in diameter,
and the other nine. The shuttles are constructed in one piece, so as to
support the lateral pressure of the water, although it is ten feet deep, by
resting one upon another. This is different from the usual mode of construction,
in which they are supported by large perpendicular beams at
every six or seven feet, in order to sustain this lateral pressure. About
twelve or thirteen hundred people are employed at these mills; and the
proprietors have built many houses, and a chapel, for their accommodation.


<span class="sidenote">Cotton
Mills.</span>


Near the mills a stone bridge of three arches has been erected
across the Derwent, at the expence of the county, the former one having
been washed down by a dreadful flood, in 1795. At a short distance,
lower down the river, is a bleaching mill, belonging to the same proprietors;
an iron forge, and two cotton mills; one of them constructed like
that before described. A stone bridge was also erected here by these
gentlemen in 1792. These mills afford regular employment to about 600
persons. A Sunday school has been established here, and another at
Belper, for the instruction of the children employed at the cotton works.</p>

<p>[A] BELTON. The church is a small ancient structure. The tower
appears to have been rebuilt in the year 1637, and at a subsequent period,
the chancel has been renewed. The church is extremely neat, and has


<span class="sidenote">Belton
House.</span>


in the south window six pieces of stained glass, illustrative of scriptural
subjects. Within the nave are several splendid monuments. Belton
House, near Grantham, the residence of Earl Brownlow, is situated on a
beautiful lawn, in a wooded valley, through which the river Witham winds
its course. The mansion was built in the year 1689, from designs by Sir
Christopher Wren. The form of the building is that of the letter H, a
stile of architecture peculiar to that period. It is of stone, and presents
four uniform elevations. The apartments are lofty, and well proportioned.
Several of the rooms are highly ornamented with carving by Gibbons.
The late Lord Brownlow made considerable improvements in the mansion.
He took down the cupola and balustrade from the roof. The drawing
room was considerably enlarged, and a new entrance at the south front
made. Here are many pictures by celebrated masters of the Flemish and
Italian schools, with numerous family portraits by Lely, Reynolds, Kneller,
Romney and others. Among the latter we may remark a portrait of
Sir John Cust, Bart., Speaker of the House of Commons, in his robes, by
Sir Joshua Reynolds. William III. in his progress through the northern
counties, honoured Belton House with his presence. The park comprises
an area of five miles in circumference, inclosed by a wall; numerous
plantations of fine trees are highly ornamental to the place. Sir
John Brownlow, K.B. afterwards Viscount Tyrconnel, enriched the library
with a valuable collection of books; he also formed some extensive gardens,
which have since been more adapted to the modern taste in gardening.</p>



<p>[B] BELVOIR. The Castle is one of the most magnificent structures in
the kingdom. It is placed on an abrupt elevation of a kind of natural
cliff, forming the termination of a peninsular hill. It has been the seat of
Manners, Dukes of Rutland, for several generations, and claims the priority
of every other building in the county in which it is situated. Belvoir
has been the site of a Castle ever since the Norman conquest; and its
possessors have been chiefly persons of eminence who have figured in the
pages of history. The view from the terraces and towers comprehends
the whole vale of Belvoir and the adjoining country as far as Lincoln,
including twenty-two of the Duke of Rutland's manors. On the southern
slope of the hill are enclosed-terraces, on which there are several flower-gardens,


<span class="sidenote">The Castle.</span>


surrounded by shrubberies. The park is of great extent, containing
fine forest trees, which form a woodland beneath the hill so extensive
as to afford shelter for innumerable rooks. Its interior and furniture
is of the most superb and costly description; it also contains one
of the most valuable collections of paintings in this country, whether considered
for the variety of the schools, or the works of each master. A
conflagration took place in the year 1816, which consumed a great portion
of the ancient part of the castle, and several of the pictures. A curious
anecdote is related, illustrative of the folly and superstition of ancient
times, which may not be uninteresting to add. Joan Flower and her two;
daughters who were servants at Belvoir Castle, having been dismissed the
family, in revenge made use of all the enchantments, spells, and charms
that were at that time supposed to answer their malicious purposes.
Henry the eldest son died soon after their dismissal, but no suspicion of
witchcraft arose till five years after, when the three women who are said


<span class="sidenote">Charge of
witchcraft.</span>


to have entered into a formal contract with the devil, were accused of
"murdering Lord Henry Ross by witchcraft and torturing the Lord
Francis his brother and Lady Catherine his sister." After various examinations
they were committed to Lincoln gaol. The mother died at
Ancaster, on her way thither, having wished the bread and butter she ate
might choak her if she was guilty. The daughters were tried before Sir
Henry Hobbert, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir Edward
Bromley, one of the Barons of the Exchequer; they confessed their guilt
and were executed at Lincoln, March 11, 1618.</p>

<p>[A] BEMERTON, a parish in the hundred of Branch and Dole. The
rectory of this place is interesting, as having been the residence of no less
than four celebrated characters, viz. Dr. Walter Curie, Bishop of Bath


<span class="sidenote">Celebrated
men.</span>


and Wells, and afterwards of Winchester, who died in 1647; George
Herbert, called the divine, who died in 1635; John Norris, a metaphysical
writer, who died in 1711; and, lastly, Mr. Archdeacon Coxe, the traveller
and historian, who died in 1828: all of them gentlemen highly distinguished
in the annals of literature.</p>



<p>[B] BENEFIELD. In this parish are some remarkable cavities, called
Swallows, which have opened a wide field of speculation among philosophers,
who have grounded, upon the singular phenomena they exhibit,
some new systems with regard to the theory of the earth. These swallows
are situated about a furlong west of the village, and are nine in number.


<span class="sidenote">Geological
curiosities.</span>


Through these cavities, the land-flood waters constantly pass and disappear.
They are of a circular form, and of various diameters; some
having an oblique, and others a perpendicular descent, opening beneath
the apertures into large spaces, which exhibit several smaller conduits,
through which the waters pass, to join perhaps, some subterranean river,
or mingle with the grand abyss of waters, which some philosophers have
placed in the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>[A] BENENDEN, or Biddenden, three miles south east from Cranbrook,
is at present populous, though the clothing manufacture, which first occasioned
the increase of the population of this part of the county, in the
reign of Edward the Third, has for many years failed here. Several good
houses still remaining, discover the prosperity of the former inhabitants.
The church is a handsome regular building, and its tower a structure of
considerable height and strength. By the old part now remaining, it
appears to have been originally but small. The interior contains several
ancient brasses, and among them, one for the Goldwells of Great Chart;
with the dates 1452, and 1499, in Arabic numerals: the rebus of this
name, a golden fountain, or well, is also in one of the windows. A free
grammar school, now degenerated into a complete sinecure, was founded
here in the year 1522. There is a tradition in this parish, that a bequest
for the use of the poor, of 20 acres of land, now called the Bread and
Cheese land, lying in five pieces, was given by two maiden sisters, commonly


<span class="sidenote">The Biddenden
maids.</span>


called the "Biddenden Maids," of the name of Chulkhurst, "who
were born joined together by the hips and shoulders, in the year 1100;"
and having lived in that state thirty-four years, died within about six
hours of each other. This tale is affected to be established by the correspondent
figures of two females impressed on cakes, which after Divine
service, in the afternoon, on every Easter Sunday, are distributed to all
comers, and not unfrequently to the number from 800 to 1000. At the same
time, about 270 loaves, weighing three pounds and a half each, and cheese
in proportion, are given to the poor parishioners; the whole expence
being defrayed from the rental of the bequeathed lands. The marvellous
part of the story however, was wholly discredited by the well informed,
until the visit of the Siamese twins to this country revived it with some
appearance of truth.</p>



<p>[B] BENFLEET lies south-west by south from Rayleigh. Here was a
castle, built by Hastings, the celebrated Danish pirate, and which building


<span class="sidenote">A pirate's
castle.</span>


Matthew of Westminster described, as having deep and wide ditches.
This fortress Alfred the Great took and destroyed in the year 890; Hasting's
wife and two sons taken therein, were sent to London. The creeks
entering the Thames round Benfleet are celebrated for their oysters.</p>



<p>[C] BENNINGTON, called Belintone in the Domesday Book, was a seat
of the Mercian kings; and here a great council of nobility and prelates
was assembled about the year 850, under King Bertulph, who on the complaint
of Askill, a monk of Croyland, of the great devastations committed
on the property of that monastery by the Danes, granted the monks a new
charter of divers "splendid liberties," and several extensive manors. In


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
charters.</span>


the 33d of Edward I. a charter of a weekly market, and a fair annually,
was granted for this manor; but the former has long fallen into disuse!
The manor was long in possession of the Bourchiers, Earls of Essex.
Robert, the third Earl, after his divorce from the infamous Lady Francis
Howard, his first wife, in 1613, sold it to Sir Julius C&aelig;sar, Knt., from
whom it descended to his son and heir, Sir Charles C&aelig;sar. This gentleman
was appointed Master of the Rolls in 1638; and, after being twice
married, and having fifteen children by both wives, died of the small-pox,
at Bennington, in 1643: this disease proved fatal also to several of his
issue, and among them, to Julius, his eldest surviving son, who dying
within a few days, was buried in the same grave with his father. Henry,
his next son, and heir, represented this county in the two first parliaments
held in the reign of Charles II.; and he was knighted by that
sovereign in 1660: he also died of the small-pox, in January 1667.


<span class="sidenote">The small-pox
fatal to
Cheshires.</span>


This manor was sold to the trustees under the will of Sir John Cheshire,
Knt. His great nephew, John Cheshire, Esq., resided in a small mansion
near the ancient castle at Bennington, which stood westward from the
church, and most probably occupied the spot whereon stood the palace of
the Saxon Kings. The artificial mount of the keep, with the surrounding
ditch, are still to be seen. The old manor-house that had been inhabited
by the C&aelig;sars, stood in the park, at a small distance from the village, but
was burnt down about fifty years ago. A small edifice, since erected on
the site, was for some years occupied by Mr. Bullock. Bennington church
is a small fabric, consisting of a nave and a chancel, with a tower at the
west end, and a chapel or burial-place connected with the chancel on the
north. Here are two ancient monuments, under arches, which form


<span class="sidenote">Their monuments.</span>


part of them, each exhibiting recumbent figures of a knight and a lady.
Many of the C&aelig;sars lie buried here. The Benstede family, sometime
lords of the manor, are supposed to have built this church, as their arms
are displayed both upon the roof and on the tower. In a niche over the
south porch, St. Michael and the dragon are sculptured.</p>

<p>[A] BENSINGTON was an ancient British town, taken from the original
inhabitants by Ceaulin, in the year 572. The west Saxons held the place
for two centuries, and appear to have constructed a castle for its defence;
but it was reduced by Offa, king of the Mercians, who defeated his rival
in a sanguinary contest. To the west of the church are a quadrangular


<span class="sidenote">A Mercian
King.</span>


bank and trench. Three sides of the embankment are much defaced.
Plot mentions an "angle of King Offa's palace near the church;" by
which he probably alludes to the same spot. In this village are several
modern buildings. The church, which is gothic, has been built at different
times. In the brick flooring of the nave are some ancient stones, with
mutilated brasses. Here is a Sunday-school supported by subscription;
and a meeting-house for methodists.</p>



<p>[B] LONG BENTON. A dreadful calamity occurred at Heaton Colliery,
in this neighbourhood, on the morning of May 3, 1815, when, by


<span class="sidenote">Dreadful
accident.</span>


the sudden influx of water from an old mine, Mr. Miller, (the under-viewer,
who left a wife and eight children), 22 workmen, 42 boys, and
37 horses, perished; and 25 widows, with about 80 children, were left to
bemoan the sudden death of their husbands and fathers. Steam-engines
were immediately employed, and every exertion was made for the recovery
of the bodies; notwithstanding which, it was not till the 6th of January,
in the following year, that the first body was found. It was that of
an old man employed on the waggon-way: and a fact worthy of notice is,
that the waste-water in which he had been immersed had destroyed the
woollen clothes, and corroded the iron parts of a knife the deceased had
in his pocket, yet his linen and the bone-haft of his knife remained entire.
Shortly after, Mr. Miller, and a few others, were discovered: they had met
a similar fate, having been overtaken by the water about a hundred yards
from the shaft to which they had been hastening to save themselves. But
the lot of these eight persons may be considered fortunate, when compared
with the unhappy beings left at work towards the rise of the mine, and as
yet unconscious of their dreadful situation. About the 16th of February,
the higher parts of the workings were explored; and now a scene truly


<span class="sidenote">Fifty-six
lives lost in
a mine.</span>


horrible was presented to view: for here lay the corpses of 56 human
beings, whom the water had never reached, being situated 35 fathoms
above its level. They had collected together near the crane, and were
found within a space of 30 yards of each other; their positions and attitudes
were various; several appeared to have fallen forwards from off an
inequality, or rather step, in the coal on which they had been sitting;
others, from their hands being clasped together, seemed to have expired
while addressing themselves to the protection of the Deity; two, who
were recognized as brothers, had died in the act of taking a last farewell
by grasping each other's hand: and one poor boy reposed in his father's
arms. Two slight cabins had been hastily constructed by nailing up deal
boards, and in one of these melancholy habitations three of the stoutest
miners had breathed their last. A large lump of horse flesh, wrapped up
in a jacket, nearly two pounds of candles, and three others, which had
died out when half-burned, were found in this apartment, if it can be so
called. One man, well known to have possessed a remarkably pacific
disposition, had retired to a distance to end his days alone, and in quiet.
Another had been placed to watch the rise or fall of the water; to ascertain
which, sticks had been placed, and was found dead at his post.
There were two horses in the part of the mine to which the people had
retired; one had been slaughtered, its entrails taken out, and hind quarters
cut up for use; the other was fastened to a stake, which it had
almost gnawed to pieces, as well as a corfe or coal basket that had been
left within its reach. That these ill-fated people perished for want of


<span class="sidenote">Cause of
their death.</span>


respirable air, and not from hunger and thirst, is certain; for most of
the flesh cut from the horse, with a considerable quantity of horse-beans,
were unconsumed, and a spring of good water issued into this part of the
colliery; besides, the unburned remains of candles afford evidence of a
still stronger nature; and by these data the coroner's jury was enabled to
pronounce a verdict accordingly. The overman had left the chalk-board,
in which it is usual to take down an account of the work done, together
with his pocket-book, in an empty corfe; on these some memorandum
might have been expected to be noted: but no writing subsequent to the
catastrophe appeared on either.&mdash;The bodies of those men which had lain
in wet places were much decayed; but where the floor was dry, though
their flesh had become much shrivelled, they were all easily recognised
by their features being entire.</p>

<p>[A] BERKELEY. This ancient, but small town, is situated upon a pleasant
eminence in the beautiful vale of Berkeley, almost east from the
Severn. In the Domesday book, it is termed a royal domain and free
borough. A nunnery is said to have existed here in the reign of Edward
the Confessor; the frail sisters of which were dispossessed of their estates,
including the manor, by the craft of Earl Godwin, who found means to
introduce into the community a profligate young man, by whom the nuns
were seduced. This conduct being reported to the King, the nunnery was


<span class="sidenote">The nunnery.</span>


dissolved, and its possessions granted to the Earl. The Conqueror afterwards
bestowed the manor on Roger, surnamed De Berkeley, a chieftain
who had accompanied him to England. Roger, his grandson, taking part
with Stephen, against Henry II., was deprived of his lands; and Berkeley
was given by that monarch to Robert Fitzharding, Governor of Bristol,
in reward for his eminent services. This nobleman was descended from
the Kings of Denmark, and in his posterity the extensive manor of
Berkeley, one of the largest in England, is still vested. Berkeley church
appears to be of the age of Henry II., though it has undergone various
alterations. Near the pulpit is a curious tomb, in memory of Thomas,
second Lord Berkeley, and Margaret, his first wife. Here also are various
other monuments of this family. The tower, which stands at some distance
from the church, was constructed about seventy years ago. In the
churchyard is the well known ludicrous epitaph, written by Dean Swift,
in memory of "Dickey Pearce, the Earl of Suffolk's fool." Berkeley
Castle appears to have been founded by Roger de Berkeley, soon after the


<span class="sidenote">The castle.</span>


Conquest; but various important additions were made to it during the
reigns of Henry II., Edward II., and Edward III. The form of the
castle approaches nearest to that of a circle; and the buildings are included
by an irregular court, with a moat. The keep is flanked by three
semi-circular towers, and a square one of subsequent construction: its
walls are high and massive: the entrance into it is under an arched doorway,
with ornamental sculpture in the Norman style, similar to one at
Arundel Castle. This fortress has been the scene of various memorable
transactions; the most remarkable, perhaps, was that of the murder of


<span class="sidenote">Murder of
Edward II.</span>


Edward II., in September, 1327, thus noticed by Gray:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Mark the year, and mark the night,<br />
When Severn shall re-echo with affright,<br />
The shrieks of death through Berkeley's roofs that ring;<br />
Shrieks of an agonising King!"
</p>

<p>Tradition states, that when the murder of King Edward had been determined
on, Adam, Bishop of Hereford, at the instigation of the Queen,
wrote to the keeper the following words; which, not possessing the distinctness
imported by punctuation, were capable of a double construction:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
"Edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est."<br />
Edward the King kill not to fear is good.
</p>

<p>The keeper, easily divining the wicked wishes of his employer, put his
royal master to death. According to another account, when the death of
this unfortunate, but weak sovereign, had been resolved on by the Queen
and Mortimer, her infamous paramour, he was removed from Kenelworth
to Berkeley Castle, by Sir John Maltravers and Sir Thomas Gourney, to
whose keeping he had been previously committed. Thomas, second Lord
Berkeley, then owner of the castle, treated him with civility and kindness,
but was, in a short time, obliged to relinquish his fortress to the government
of Maltravers and Gourney, by whom the King was soon afterwards
murdered, in the most brutal and savage manner. "His crie," says Holinshed,
"did move many within the castell and town of Birckelei to compassion,
plainly hearing him utter a waileful noyse, as the tormentors
were about to murder him; so that dyvers being awakened thereby, (as
they themselves confessed,) prayed heartilie to God to receyve his soule,
when they understode by his crie what the matter ment." A small apartment,
called the dungeon room, over the flight of steps leading into the
keep, is shewn as the place where the cruel deed was committed: at that
time, all the light it received was from arrow slits; the windows have
been since introduced. A plaister cast kept here, and said to have been
moulded from the King's face after death, is, in reality, a cast from his
effigies on the tomb at Gloucester. Berkeley Castle, during the civil wars,
was held for the King; and frequent skirmishes took place in the town
and neighbourhood. In 1645 it was besieged, and surrendered to the


<span class="sidenote">Besieged by
the Parliament.</span>


parliament, after a defence of nine days. In the apartments, which are
mostly low, dark, and void of proportion, are preserved a numerous assemblage
of portraits, chiefly of the Stratton branch, the bequest of the
last heir of that family. Besides these portraits, here are several miniatures
of the Berkeleys, of considerable antiquity, and so far curious. A
few landscapes, by Wouvermans, Claude, Salvator Rosa, &amp;c. complete the
Berkeley collection. Edward Jenner, an English physician, celebrated for
having introduced the practice of vaccination, as a preventive of the small-pox,


<span class="sidenote">Edward
Jenner.</span>


was the youngest son of a clergyman, who held the rectory of Rochampton,
and the vicarage of this place, and the son was born here, May
17, 1749. Being destined for the medical profession, he was, after a
common school education, placed as an apprentice with a very respectable
surgeon, at Sodbury, in his native country. He visited London, to finish
his studies, by attending the lectures of the celebrated anatomist John
Hunter. Returning to the country, he settled here, as a practitioner of
the various branches of his profession. A situation like this afforded but
little leisure or opportunity for acquiring distinction, and an occasion presented
itself for obtaining a larger field for observation, improvement, and
emolument: this, however, he was induced to decline. The circumstances
of the transaction are thus related by Dr. Lettsom, in his address to the
London Medical Society:&mdash;"Dr. Jenner happened to dine with a large
party at Bath, when something was introduced at the table which required
to be warmed by the application of the candle, and doubts were
expressed by several persons present, whether the most speedy way would
be to keep the flame at a little distance under, or to immerse the substance
into it. Jenner desired that the candle might be placed near him, and
immediately putting his finger into the flame, suffered it to remain some
time; next he put his finger above it, but he was obliged to snatch it
away immediately. 'This, gentlemen,' said he, 'is a sufficient test.'
The next day he received a note from General Smith, who had been of the
party the preceding day, and who was before that time an utter stranger,
offering him an appointment in India, which would insure him, in the


<span class="sidenote">Anecdote.</span>


course of two or three years, an annual income &pound;3,000. The offer was
referred to his brother, and Jenner, from his attachment to him, declined
it." He had already obtained the reputation of a man of talent and
science, when he made known to the world the very important discovery
which has raised him to an enviable situation among the benefactors of
the human race. His investigations concerning the cow-pox were commenced
about the year 1776, when his attention was excited by the circumstance
of finding that some individuals, to whom he attempted to
communicate the small-pox by inoculation, were insusceptible of the disease;
and on inquiry he found that all such patients, though they had
never had the small-pox, had undergone the casual cow-pox, a disease
common among the farmers and dairy-servants in Gloucestershire, who
were not quite unacquainted with its preventive effect. Other medical


<span class="sidenote">Discovery of
vaccination
by the cow-pox.</span>


men were aware of the prevalence of this opinion; but they treated it as
a popular prejudice, and Jenner seems to have been the first who ascertained
its correctness, and endeavoured to derive from it some practical
advantage. He discovered that the variol&aelig; vaccin&aelig;, as the complaint has
been since termed, having, in the first-instance, been produced by accidental
or designed innoculation of the matter afforded by a peculiar
disease affecting the udder of a cow, could be propagated from one human
subject to another by inoculation, to an indefinite extent, rendering all
who passed through it secure from the small-pox. He made known his
discovery to some medical friends, and in the month of July, 1796, Mr.
Cline, surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, introduced vaccination into the
metropolis. So singular and anomalous a fact as the prevention of an infectious
disease by means of another, in many respects extremely differing
from it, could not but be received with hesitation; and a warm controversy
took place on the subject among the medical faculty. This ultimately
proved advantageous both to the discovery and the discoverer, as it terminated
in establishing the truth of the most important positions which
he had advanced, and left him in full possession of the merit due to him
as a successful investigator of the laws of nature. The practice of vaccine
inoculation was adopted in the army and navy, and honours and rewards
were conferred on the author of the discovery. The diploma constituting
him doctor of medicine, was presented to Jenner as a tribute to his talents,
by the University of Oxford; he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society,


<span class="sidenote">Jenner's
subsequent
fame.</span>


and of other learned associations; and a parliamentary grant was made to
him of the sum of &pound;20,000. The extension of the benefits of vaccination
to foreign countries spread the fame of the discoverer, who received
several congratulatory addresses from continental potentates. The emperor
of Russia, when in this country in 1814, sought an interview with
Dr. Jenner, treated him with great attention, and offered to bestow on him
a Russian order of nobility. He also visited the King of Prussia, Marshal
Blucher, and the Cossack General, Count Platoff, the latter of whom said
to him, "Sir, you have extinguished the most pestilential disorder that
ever appeared on the banks of the Don." On receiving his diploma, Dr.
Jenner practised as a physician at Cheltenham, during the season, and
that watering-place was his principal residence till he became a widower,
when he removed to Berkeley, to spend in retirement the evening of his
life. He died suddenly in consequence of apoplexy, January 26, 1823,
and was interred in the parish church of this town.</p>

<p>[A] BERKHAMPSTEAD. "The Saxons, in old time," observes Norden,
"called this town Berghamstedt, because it was seated among the hills;
for Berg signified a hill; ham, a town; and stedt, a seat; all of which
was very proper for the situation hereof." The buildings are chiefly of
brick, and irregular, but intersected with various handsome houses. Berkhampstead


<span class="sidenote">Description.</span>


consists of one principal street, about half a mile in length, extending
along the side of the high road; and another smaller one branching
out from the church towards the site of the castle. The Grand
Junction Canal runs the whole length of the town, and very close to it,
which makes it a place of considerable trade. Many respectable and genteel
families reside here, and hold their monthly balls at the King's Arms
Inn, during the winter. The King of Mercia had a palace or castle here;
and the town had attained sufficient importance at the time of the Conquest,
to be appointed as the place of meeting between the Norman
sovereign, and the chiefs of the confederacy formed against his power, and
headed by Abbot Fretheric, of St. Alban's. "In the brough," says the
Domesday Book, "are two and fifty burgesses, who pay four pounds a
year for toll; and they have half a hide, and two shillings rent, common
of pasture for the cattle, wood to feed a thousand hogs, and five shillings
rent by the year. Its whole value is sixteen pounds. The castle erected
by the Saxons was enlarged, strengthened, and fortified with additional

outworks, by the Earl of Mortaigne; but in the time of his son and successor,
William, who had rebelled against Henry I., it was seized, and
ordered to be razed to the ground." It is probable, however, that the
demolition was only partial, as it was again fitted up as a royal residence,
either in the time of Stephen, or early in the reign of Henry II. The
castle and honour of Berkhampstead continued in the possession of the
crown till the seventh of King John, who granted them to the Earl of
Essex, for &pound;100. per annum. In the year 1216 the castle, which had been
reverted to the crown, was besieged by Lewis, Dauphin of France, in
conjunction with certain English barons. The garrison, taking advantage
of the negligence of the besiegers, made two successful sallies on the same
day, capturing divers chariots, arms, and provisions; but, after a siege of
some continuance, they surrendered. Henry III. granted the Earldom of


<span class="sidenote">The seat of
Kings and
Nobles.</span>


Cornwall, with the honour and castle of Berkhampstead, to Richard, his
brother, for his services at the siege of the castle of Riole, in France; but,
disagreeing with him, he revoked the grant. The interposition of the
Earls of Pembroke and Chester occasioned its restoration to the Earl of
Cornwall. In 1245, the King granted him an annual fair, of eight days'
continuance, for his manor of Berkhampstead; and here, after a long illness,
he died on the 4th of April, 1272. Edmund, his only surviving son,
succeeded to his estates and titles; and in his time there were twelve
burgesses within the borough, with fifty-two free tenants, and twenty-two
tenants by serjeancy. This Earl founded the college of Bon-Hommes,
at Ashridge, in Buckinghamshire. In the fourth of Edward III., John of
Eltham, brother to the King, had a grant of Berkhampstead, with other
manors, to the value of 2,000 marks per annum: but, dying without
issue, in 1336, his estates were granted by the King, to Edward the Black
Prince, with the Dukedom of Cornwall, to be held by him and his heirs,
and the eldest sons of the heirs of the King's of England. Richard II.
occasionally resided at Berkhampstead castle. Since that period, the castle
and honour of Berkhampstead have descended from the crown, to the successive
Princes of Wales, as heirs apparent to the throne, and possessors
of the Dukedom of Cornwall, under the grant of Edward III. The castle
was situated on the east side of the town; and, though the buildings are


<span class="sidenote">Now in
ruins.</span>


now reduced to a few massive fragments of wall, the remains are still
sufficient to evince the ancient strength and importance of this fortress.
The ramparts are very bold, and the ditches still wide and deep, particularly
on the north and east sides, though partly filled up by the lapse of
centuries. The keep was a circular tower, occupying the summit of a
high and steep artificial mount, moated round. Large trees are now
growing on the sides of the mount, as well as on many parts of the outward
rampart, and declivities of the ditches: other parts are covered with
underwood, in many places so thick as to be impassable. The inner court
is now an orchard; the outer court is cultivated as a farm; and a small
cottage, with a few out-buildings, now occupies a portion of the ground
once occupied by Princes and Sovereigns. Near the rampart, on the west
side, flows the little river Bulbourne. The church, dedicated to St. Peter,
is built in the form of a cross, with a tower rising from the intersection
towards the west end, and having a projecting staircase at the south-east
angle, terminated by a turret at the summit. The tower is supported on
strong pointed arches, and was originally open, but is now closed from
the church by the belfry floor. On the outside of the tower, next the
street, is a sculpture of an angel supporting a shield, impaled with the
arms of England and France quarterly. The same arms are painted on
glass in the window of a small chapel within the church. Various chapels


<span class="sidenote">The church.</span>


and chantries were founded here in the Catholic times, and are still partially
divided from the body of the church. The sepulchral memorials are
numerous. Between two columns of the nave, surrounded by pews, is an
ancient tomb of rich workmanship, having on the top, full-length effigies
of a Knight and his Lady, both recumbent. The Knight is represented in
armour, with his hands raised in the attitude of prayer across his breast:
his head rests on a helmet, having a human head, with a long beard, at
the upper end; his feet are supported on a lion: he has on a hood and
gorget of mail; and, on the sash, which crosses his body and shoulder,
is a rose: opposite to this, on his breast-plate, is a dove. The figure of
the lady is greatly mutilated; her hands and head are broken off; the
latter rests on a cushion, and is covered with net-work; she is arrayed in
a close dress, and has a rose on each shoulder. No inscription is remaining
on this tomb to designate the persons to whose memory it was erected.
Torynton is supposed to have been the founder of the church; a man in
special favour with Edmond Plantagenet, Duke of Cornwall. In Sayer's
chancel is an altar-tomb of alabaster and black marble, in the memory of
John Sayer, Esq., who was chief cook to Charles II. when in exile, and
founder of the alms-house for poor widows in this town. A large and
strong building of brick, erected as a free-school in the reign of Henry

VIII., and endowed with the lands of the guild or brotherhood of St.
John the Baptiste, (an ancient foundation in this town,) stands at the
bottom of the churchyard. In the next reign the school was made a
royal foundation, and incorporated. The master is appointed by the
crown, and has apartments at one end of the free school; the school-room
occupies the centre; and the other end is inhabited by the chaplain and
usher. Here is also a charity-school, supported by voluntary contributions,
&amp;c. Numerous donations for charitable purposes have been made to this
parish, the principal of which was a bequest of &pound;1,000., made by John
Sayer, Esq., in July, 1681, for the building and endowment of an alms
house: this was erected after his decease by his relict, who placed in it
six poor widows, and increased the original endowment by the gift of
&pound;300. Each widow has a small allowance weekly, and a cloth gown
worth 20s. once in two years. In the 14th of Edward III., two representatives
were sent from this borough; but this was the only return
ever made, except to the great council held at Westminster, in the 11th of
the same King. Berkhampstead had a charter of incorporation granted by
James I., but it scarcely survived the reign of his son. An attempt was
made to revive the charter, a year or two after the restoration, but it did
not succeed. The honour of Berkhampstead formerly included upwards of
fifty-five lordships and manors, in the three counties of Herts, Northampton,
and Buckingham. Berkhampstead-place is situated on a pleasant


<span class="sidenote">Contained fifty-five lordships.</span>


eminence adjoining the town. Great part of the structure was erected by
the Careys, having been burnt down in the time of the Lord Treasurer
Weston, who then resided in it: the remainder was afterwards repaired,
and with some additions, forms the present dwelling. King James's
children were mostly nursed in this house. The life of Cowper, the poet,
who was born here, will be given at Olney, on account of the length of the
present article.</p>

<p>[A] BERKSHIRE. This county was originally inhabited by three tribes
or nations, termed by the Romans Attrebates, Bibroces, and Segontiaci.


<span class="sidenote">Its ancient
division into
three nations.</span>


The first occupied part of the west, the south-west and north-west parts.
The second the south-east parts; and the third a portion of the north parts.
Under the Romans, this county formed part of the first division called
Britannia Prima. During the Heptarchy it belonged to the West Saxons.
It was once called Berrocshire, from the name of a hill covered with box,
which at one time occupied a large portion of it. It is an inland county,
bounded on the north by the Thames, which divides it from Oxfordshire
on the west, and Bucks on the east; and by part of Surrey; on the north
by Surrey and Hampshire; and on the west by Wilts and a small part of
Gloucestershire. It is so very irregular in its shape as not to admit of
any adequate description. Its greatest length is about forty-eight miles,
and its utmost breadth from north to south about twenty-five. In one of
the narrowest parts, by Reading, it is about six or seven miles, and less
still at the eastern extremity. It contains about 464,500 acres, and is
about 140 miles in circumference; it is in the province of Canterbury,
and the diocese of Salisbury; (the parish of Chilton, which is in the
diocese of Oxford, and Langford, which is in that of Lincoln, excepted;)
subject to an archdeacon, and is divided into six deaneries. It is included
in the Oxford circuit. There are 20 hundreds, 12 market towns, 148
parishes (of which 67 are vicarages,) and 671 villages. The natural divisions
of the county are four, 1. The Vale, beginning at Budcot, and ending
at Streatley. 2. The Chalky Hills, running nearly through the centre
of the lower part of the county. 3. The Vale of the Kennet, extending
diagonally from Hungerford to near Wargrave. 4. The Forest Division,
commencing on the east to Loddon, and occupying nearly the entire breadth
of this part of the county to Old Windsor, and from Sandhurst south to
Maidenhead north. The air is deemed peculiarly salubrious, particularly


<span class="sidenote">Air, soil,
and rivers.</span>


on the chalky and gravelly soils, which are the most common throughout
the county; but the uneven face of the country causes some slight degree
of variation in this particular, though every part is considered healthful
and good. The soil is as various (though perhaps more mixed) as in the
last described county. The Vale of White Horse consists generally of a
rich strong loam and gravel, with some sand and stone brasp, producing
corn, wheat, beans, &amp;c. In the Chalk Hill district, light black earth on
chalk prevails, with flint, chalk, gravel, and loam. Here numerous sheep
are fed; it produces, towards the south and east, turnips, barley; and,
when properly manured, Lammas wheat and artificial grasses. The Vale
of Kennet, is generally peat land, with gravel, loam and clay, though in the
south east parts a poor stony and heathy soil. The Forest District, gravel,
clay, and loam, except on the south, which is poor and heathy. The principal
rivers and streams are the Thames, the Kennet, the Loddon, the
Lambourn, the Ock, the Aubourn, the Emme, and the Broadwater. All
these, with perhaps the exception of the Aubourn, the Emme, and the
Broadwater, abound with almost every kind of fresh water fish. Besides
these rivers and streams, there are the Ginge Brook, the Moreton Brook,
and other rivulets, &amp;c.; also some other natural and artificial lakes and
ponds. Water, however, is generally scarce on the Berkshire downs, and
along the whole of the chalky stratum. The navigable rivers are the
Thames and the Kennet. The navigable canals are the Kennet and Avon
canal, which joins the river Kennet a little above Newbury; the entire
length from Newbury to Bath is sixty miles&mdash;it has been navigable since
the year 1798; and the Wilts and Berks canal, opened on September 21,
1810, into the Thames at Abingdon; from near Bath to Abingdon, about
fifty-one and three-quarter miles. Mineral waters are by no means common
in this county. The natural productions of this county, except
those which may be considered partly agricultural, are neither plentiful
or important. There are no minerals nor fossils of any great consequence.


<span class="sidenote">Natural
productions.</span>


The strata of sand with oyster-shells, and particularly a thick
stratum of chalk, is found near Reading. The surface of the soil,
however, amply compensates for the apparent barrenness of the internal
parts; and the produce of fat cattle, sheep, swine, and grain, is
immense; as is also that of fine timber, especially oak and beech. Abingdon
gives the title of Earl to the Bertie family&mdash;Coleshill, that of Baron to
the Pleydell-Bouverie family&mdash;Foxley, that of Baron to the Townshend family&mdash;Hungerford,
that of Baron to the Rawdon-Hastings family&mdash;Mortimer,
the title of Earl to the Harley family&mdash;Newbury, that of Baron to the
Cholmondely family&mdash;Uffingham, that of Viscount to the Craven family&mdash;and
Windsor, the title of Baron to the Windsor-Hickman family; and
Earl, to the Stuarts. It has been calculated, that, including houses, mills,
and other productive revenue arising from or attached to the soil, the
landed property cannot amount to less than &pound;500,000 per annum, and
that the largest possessor may have about &pound;8000. The largest possessor,
being a peer, is the Earl of Craven. The Craven, Englefield, Eyston, Read,


<span class="sidenote">Ancient and
noble families.</span>


Southby, Seymour, and Clarke families are among the few ancient families
who still inherit the same estates, and occupy the same seats, or are immediately
connected with the county, as their ancestors. Among the
representatives of some very old families, or in the female line, may be
ranked the Berties, the Nevilles, the Pleydells, the Puseys, the Throckmortons,
the Lovedens, the Nelsons, and the Blagraves. The King is
purposely omitted in this brief list:&mdash;his possessions as a landed proprietor
being well known. Agriculture so much engrosses the attention
of the people of Berkshire, that very little trade, unconnected with
these pursuits is carried on. There are, however, some manufactories
of sail-cloth, kerseys, canvass, and malt; and there are also several
pretty large breweries in various parts of the county: the Windsor ale
having acquired considerable celebrity; and at the Temple mills, near
Bisham, there is a copper manufacture, and a manufacture of potash at
Milton.</p>

<p>[A] BERMONDSEY stretches along the banks of the Thames, from Southwark
to Deptford, and Rotherhithe eastward, and is much inhabited by
woolstaplers, fellmongers, curriers, parchment-makers, and other manufacturers,
with such craftsmen as are connected with the construction and
management of shipping. A priory for monks was founded here in 1082,
by Aylwin Child, a citizen of London, and endowed by the second William
with his manor of Bermondsey. In 1399, it was made an abbey,
and at the dissolution, it was granted to Sir Thomas Pope, who built on
its site a large house, which afterwards became the property and residence
of the Earls of Sussex. Another part of the site is called the Abbey House.


<span class="sidenote">Royal residence.</span>


Catherine, the Queen of Henry V., and Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV.
retired to this place, where they died, the former in 1436; the latter
soon after the forfeiture of her lands, by an order of the Council, in 1486.
The church was erected in 1680, of brick, with a low square tower and
turret, and consists of a chancel, nave, two aisles, and a transept. A free
school was founded here by Mr. Josiah Bacon, and endowed with a revenue
of &pound;150. for the instruction of not more than sixty, or fewer than forty
boys. A charity-school was also established, by contributions, in 1755,
for the education of fifty boys and thirty girls, and was afterwards endowed


<span class="sidenote">Church and

by Mr. Nathaniel Smith, with a revenue of &pound;40. per annum. The
Bermondsey Spa was discovered in 1770, and, by means of the attractive
entertainments contrived by the proprietor, became a place of general resort;
but soon after his death the gardens were closed, and the area is now
built upon. This suburban parish long retained a very antique air from
the age of several of its streets and houses, many of which were built of
wood. But the spirit of improvement has gradually amended its appearance:
an act of parliament was passed in the year 1823, for watching,
paving, cleansing, and lighting the parish. A new church has been
erected here for the convenience of the parishioners, at a moderate distance
from the mother church; it is, however, subordinate to the original
rectory.</p>

a rocky eminence, rising over a pellucid brook, now form, in combination
with the other features of the scenery, one of the most delightful views in
Devonshire. The approach to the castle, observes Dr. Matton, in his
Observations on the Western Counties, "is through a thick wood, extending
along the slope of a range of hills that entirely intercept any prospect to
the south: on the opposite side is a steep rocky ridge, covered with oak,
so that the ruins are shut into a beautiful valley. The great gate, with
the walls of the south front, the north wing of the court, or quadrangle,
some apartments on the west side, and a turret or two, are the principal
remains of the building; and these are so finely overhung with the
branches of trees and shrubs which grow close to the walls, so beautifully
mantled with ivy, and so richly incrusted with moss, that they constitute
the most picturesque objects that can be imagined; and when the surrounding
scenery is taken into the account, the noble mass of wood fronting
the gate, the bold ridges rising in the horizon, and the fertile valley
opening to the east, the ruins of Berry Pomeroy Castle must be considered
as almost unparalleled in their effect." The posterity of Ralph
de Pomeroy resided here till the reign of Edward VI., when Sir Thomas
Pomeroy sold the manor to Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, from
whom it has descended to the present Duke of Somerset. Berry Pomeroy
Castle, whose venerable ruins we have just mentioned, appears to have
been originally quadrangular, and to have had but one entrance, which was
on the south side, between two hexagonal towers, through a double gateway;
the first of which was machiolated, and strengthened by angular
bastions, and having over it the Pomeroy arms, still visible. A small
room over the gateway was probably the chapel: it is divided by a
wall, supported by pillars and arches. From the eastern tower is a fine
view of the surrounding country. The ruins in the interior part, or quadrangle,
are considerably more modern than the rest of the building. These
appear to have belonged to a "magnificent structure," commenced, says
Prince, in his Worthies of Devonshire, by the Seymours, at an expense of


<span class="sidenote">Former
state of the
castle.</span>


&pound;20,000, but "never brought to perfection: for the west side of the
mansion was never begun: what was finished may be thus described.
Before the door of the Great Hall was a noble walk whose length was the
breadth of the court, arched over with curiously carved free-stone, supported
in the fore part by several stately pillars of the same stone, of great
dimensions, after the Corinthian order, standing on pedestals, having
cornices and freezes finely wrought. The apartments within were very
splendid, especially the dining-room; and many other of the rooms were
well adorned with mouldings and fret-work; some of whose marble
clavils were so delicately fine, that they would reflect an object true and
lively from a great distance. Notwithstanding which it is now demolished,
and all this glory lyeth in the dust, buried in its own ruins; there being
nothing standing but a few broken walls, which seem to mourn their own
approaching funerals." The walls are formed of slate, and appear to be
rapidly decaying. The grounds round the castle consist of steep eminences,
covered with oak and other trees. Even in the court, and remains of the
fortress itself, trees of nearly a century's growth are flourishing in
luxuriance, and compose, with the shrubs thickly scattered within the area,
a scene highly beautiful. In the wars between Charles I. and the
Parliament this castle was dismantled. Berry Pomeroy Church, which
was built by one of the Pomeroy family, contains a splendid alabaster
monument to the memory of Lord Edward Seymour, Knt. son to the
Duke of Somerset; Edward Seymour, Bart. and his Lady, the daughter
of Sir Arthur Champernoune. The two first are represented in armour;
the knight having a truncheon in his hand, and lying cross-legged. The
lady is in a black dress, with the figure of a child, in a cradle, at her
head, and at her feet another in a chair: below are nine figures kneeling,
with books open before them. This monument was repaired by the
late Duke of Somerset, the eighth lineal descendant of the Duke of Somerset
the Protector.</p>

<p>[A] BERWICK. The town is situated N. by W. from Newcastle. King
Edgar gave it, with Coldingham, to the church of Durham; but it was afterwards
forfeited by Bishop Flambard. It had a church in the reign of Alexander,
and, in David's time constituted one of the four boroughs where
courts of trade were wont to be held. In 1173, it was reduced to ashes;
and in the following year, Earl Duncan marched to the place, and butchered
its defenceless inhabitants. Henry II. having obtained the castle as a pledge
for King William, strengthened its fortifications. It was restored, however,


<span class="sidenote">The disputed
town.</span>


in the following reign. King John made dreadful ravages in the town and
neighbourhood. A convention was held here by Edward I., in 1291, to
arbitrate the claims to the crown of Scotland, which were at length
determined in favour of his creature, Baliol. This prince having shortly
afterwards thrown off his allegiance, Berwick became exposed to the fury
of Edward's resentment. In 1296, the English king fortified it with a wall
and a fosse, and in the same year received the homage of the Scotch nobility
here In 1297, the town was taken by Sir William Wallace; but the
castle held out, and after a long assault, was relieved. Wallace about eight
years after this was betrayed, and half of his body exposed upon Berwick-bridge.
The Countess of Buchan, for crowning Robert Bruce, at Scone,


<span class="sidenote">Countess of

was shut up here in a wooden cage, six years, and then released. Edward
II. and his queen wintered at Berwick in 1310. He assembled his army
here before the battle of Bannockburn. Peter Spalding betrayed this place
into the hands of Robert Bruce in 1318: many attempts were made to
recover it, which was not effected till the day after the battle of Hallidon-hill,
in 1333. Edward III. was here in 1335, with a great army in 1340,
and the year after, at Easter, held a tournament; but during his absence in
France, in November 1353, the Scots surprized and took the town. The
castle, under the renowned Sir John Copeland, held out till Edward, in
February following, arrived with a great army, and forced the Scotch to
capitulate. Seven Scotchmen, in 1377, surprised the castle, and held it
eight days against 7,000 archers, and 3,000 cavalry. The deputy-governor,
under the Earl of Northumberland, betrayed it into the enemy's hands in
1384; but the earl soon after recovered it. Through the solicitation of
his uncle the Earl of Worcester, engaging in the rebellion against Henry IV.,
in 1406, he employed this fortress against the king; but a cannon-shot,
the first that was ever fired in England, so alarmed the garrison, that it,
immediately surrendered. According to Walsingham and Speed, this shot
was of a large size, and demolished great part of a tower. In 1811, a


<span class="sidenote">The first
cannon-ball
used in

all of cast iron, weighing ninety-six pounds, answering to this account,
was found in a part of the ruins of the castle. It had penetrated the wall
about three yards, at a place where it was flanked with a tower. An
unsuccessful attempt was made to reduce it in 1422; but after the battle
of Towton, in 1461, it was again in the hands of the Scots, who
strengthened its walls, and held it till 1482, when it finally came into
possession of the English. "From that time," observes Camden, "the
kings of England have continually added works to it, particularly Queen
Elizabeth, who, lately to the terror of the enemy, and security of the
towns-people, contracted the circuit of the walls, drawing within the old
ones a very high wall, well built of strong stone, surrounded by a deep
ditch, a regular rampart, redoubt, counterscarps, and covered ways, so
that the form and strength of the fortifications are sufficient to discourage
all hopes of carrying it by assault, not to mention the bravery of the
garrison, and the stores in the place, which exceed belief." Between the
years 1761 and 1770 the walls were almost entirely rebuilt in many parts,
and finished in 1786. The governor of Berwick has a salary of &pound;586. 7s. 1d.
The barracks measure 217 by 121; and contain twenty-four rooms for
officers, and seventy-two rooms adapted to hold 567 privates. The church
of Berwick, a peculiar of the dean and chapter of Durham, stands on the
north side of the parade. It was rebuilt between 1642 and 1652, at the
cost of &pound;1400. It has no steeple. It consists of three aisles, and several
galleries, all handsomely pewed. The Worshipful Mercers' Company,
in London, founded a lectureship here. David I., King of Scotland,


<span class="sidenote">The church
and convents.</span>


founded here a convent for Cistertian Nuns; and Robert III, granted
its revenues to Dryburgh Abbey. The convent of Carmelites originated
with Sir John Grey, in 1270. The Scotch King, in 1239, brought
hither a convent of Dominicans, which Edward III. removed. The
Trinitarians had a house here, as had the Franciscans; and between the
sea and the town, in Maudlin-field, stood the hospital and free chapel of
St. Mary Magdalen, which had an hospital or hermitage belonging to it
at Segeden.&mdash;Queen Elizabeth founded a free school here; and a charity-school
was rebuilt in 1725, in which twenty boys and six girls are clothed
and educated. Berwick bridge was swept away by a flood in 1199. It


<span class="sidenote">The bridge
24 years in
building.</span>


was rebuilt of wood, of which it consisted, till the time of James I., who
commenced the present elegant structure of stone. It has fifteen arches;
its length being 1164 feet, and its breadth seventeen. It was twenty-four
years, four months, and four days in building, and cost government
&pound;14,960 1s. 6d. The Town Hall was built in 1754. On its ground-floor,
on the east-side, is a piazza, called the Exchange; and opposite it are cells
for criminals, and shops. The second floor consists of two spacious halls.
The outer hall, for holding courts and guilds, measures, sixty feet by
thirty-one. The inner hall forty-seven feet long and twenty-three feet
broad, is occasionally occupied for public entertainments. The upper
story is the common gaol of the town. The turret, 150 feet high, contains
eight musical bells. The first charter of the corporation was granted by
Edward I. The corporation were first summoned to send members to
parliament in the latter end of the reign of Edward IV. The last charter
of this town was granted by James I. The corporation now consists of a
mayor, recorder, town clerk, four bailiffs, a coroner, four serjeants at mace,


<span class="sidenote">Municipal
officers.</span>


and a water-bailiff. The mayor is also escheator in the borough, clerk of
the market, and a justice of the peace; the other justices of the town being
the recorder and such resident burgesses as have sustained the office of
mayor. They are lords of the manor of Tweedmouth, where they hold a
court-leet and court-baron twice a year. Their annual revenues arising
from duties taken at the quay and gates, are estimated at &pound;7000. Besides
the trade in salmon, great quantities of corn and eggs are exported here for
London. One morning in the month of October, 1814, there were upwards
of 10,000 salmon, in Berwick market, caught in the Tweed, some of which
might have been bought at 2s. each. At the same time, the finest herrings


<span class="sidenote">Salmon and
herring
fisheries.</span>


(of which an immense shoal was on the coast) were sold for 2s. the hundred
of six score. On the same day the best salmon was sold in Newcastle
market at 6d. per pound, and some of the inferior kind as low as 4d. The
port has about sixty or seventy vessels. The harbour abounds with low
dangerous rocks. At its mouth a noble pier has recently been constructed
on the site of an old one, built by Queen Elizabeth. Berwick Castle,
once a place of high importance, is now almost levelled with the ground.
About 400 yards north of it, is a pentagonal tower, called the Bell Tower,
having its name from containing a bell, which was rung on any occasion
of alarm.</p>

<p>[A] BESSELSLEIGH, is a small village, in the hundred of Hormer. The
manor formerly belonged to the family of Legh, from which it passed, by
a female heir, to that of Besils, or Blesells, which flourished there for
several centuries. "At this Legh," says Leland, "be very fayre pastures
and woodes. The Blesells hathe bene lords of it syns the tyme of
Edwarde the First, or afore, and ther they dyd enhabite. The place is
all of stone, and stondithe at the west end of the paroche churche. The

were countyd to have pocessyons of 400 marks by the yere." In the
year 1516, the estates of the Blesells were carried, by the marriage of an
heiress, to the Fettiplaces, a respectable Berkshire family, one of whom
Besil Fettiplace, Esq., was High Sheriff in the 26th of Queen Elizabeth.
The manor of Besselsleigh was purchased of the Fettiplaces, by William
Lenthall, Esq., Speaker of the Long Parliament, whose descendants now
reside at Burford, in Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>[A] BETHNAL GREEN. There is a curious legend relating to this
place, of which Henry de Mountfort, son of the ambitious Earl of Liecester,
who was slain with his father at the memorable battle of Evesham, is the
hero. He is supposed to have been discovered among the bodies of the
dying and the dead (by a young lady) in an almost lifeless state, and deprived
of his sight by a wound which he had received during the engagement.
Under the fostering hand of this "faire damosel" he soon recovered, and
afterwards marrying her, she became the mother of the celebrated
"Besse," the heroine of the popular ballad of the beggar's daughter of
Bethnal-green, written in the reign of Elizabeth. Fearing least his rank


<span class="sidenote">The blind
beggar of
Bethnal-green.</span>


and title should be discovered by his enemies, he is said to have disguised
himself as a beggar, and taken up his residence at Bethnal-green. The
beauty of the daughter attracted many suitors, and she was at length
married to a noble knight, who, regardless of her supposed meanness and
poverty, had the courage to make her his wife: her other lovers having
deserted her on account of her low origin. At Bethnal-green is an old
mansion, which the inhabitants, with their usual love of traditionary lore,
assign as the palace of the blind beggar. The tradition, though with very
little grounds for its foundation, is still preserved on the sign posts of
several public houses in the neighbourhood. On the 19th September, 1826,
the parish officers of Bethnal-green waited on the Secretary of State for


<span class="sidenote">Gang of 500
thieves, in
1826.</span>


the Home Department, and stated that a lawless gang, of 500 or more,
thieves infested that neighbourhood and committed the most dreadful
outrages nightly, upwards of fifty persons having been robbed and beaten
in the course of a week; the secretary ordered forty men mounted, to
patrole the parish, and aid the local authorities in bringing the offenders
to justice. The hospital called the Trinity House, founded in the year 1695,
for twenty-eight ancient seamen, who have been masters of ships, and their
widows, is in this parish. The funds arising from the ballast-offices, lighthouses,
buoys, beacons, &amp;c. are appropriated by parliament to this corporation.
Each of the inmates receives 16s. a month, 20s. a year for coals,
and a new gown every second year. Many of the streets of this parish are
almost wholly occupied by the operative silk-weavers.</p>

<p>[C] BETTWS BLEDDRWS. In this neighbourhood there exists a
curious custom relating to marriage, called a bidding, which takes place
about a week previous to the day of ceremony. The banns are published
as in England. A bidder goes from house to house, with a long pole and
ribbons flying at the end of it, and standing in the middle floor in each
house, he repeats a long lesson, with great formality. He mentions the
day of the wedding, the place, the preparations made, &amp;c. The following
is a specimen:&mdash;Speech of the Bidder in 1762. "The intention of the
bidder is this; with kindness and amity, with decency and liberality for
Einion Owain, and Llio Elys, he invites you to come with your good will
on the plate; bring current money; a shilling, or two, or three, or four,
or five; with cheese and butter we invite the husband and wife, and
children, and men-servants, from the greatest to the least. Come there


<span class="sidenote">Curious
marriage
customs.</span>


early, you shall have victuals freely, and drink cheap, stools to sit on,
and fish if we can catch them; but if not, hold us excuseable; and they
will attend on you when you call in upon them in return. They set out
from such a place to such a place." The gwahodder, or bidder, has eight
or ten shillings for his trouble. Saturday is always fixed on as the day of
marriage, and Friday is allotted to bring home the furniture of the
woman, consisting generally of an oak chest, a feather bed, clothes, &amp;c.
The man provides a bedstead, a table, a dresser and chairs. The evening
is moreover employed in receiving presents of money, cheese, and butter, at
the man's house, from his friends, and at the woman's house from her
friends. This is called purse and girdle, it is an ancient British custom.
All these presents are set down minutely on paper. If demanded, they
are to be repaid. On Saturday, the friends of the man come all on horseback,
from the number of eighty to a hundred, and have bread and cheese,
and ale at his cost, making at the same time their presents, or pay pwython,
i.e. the presents that have been made at their weddings. From ten to
twenty of the best mounted go to the intended bride's house to demand
her. The woman with her friends are expecting the summons, but she
appears very uncomplying, and much Welsh poetry is employed by way
of argument; one party being within the house, the other without, abusing
each other much. Several persons then deliver orations on horseback,
with their hats off, demanding the daughter from the father, who were
answered by persons appointed for the business. At length the father
appears, admitting and welcoming his guests. They alight, walk in, take
some refreshments, and proceed to church. The girl mounts behind her
father, mother, or friend, upon the swiftest horse that can be procured.
Her friends then pretend to run away with her, riding like mad folks, in
any direction. During this time, the girl has no pillion, sitting upon the
crupper, and holding by the man's coat, at last the horse is tired, or the
bride growing impatient consents to go, using only some feints to get out
of the road, till they arrive at the church. The ceremony being over,
they return to the married couple's house, eating at free cost, but finding
their own liquor. Sunday being come, the married pair stay at home receiving
good will and pwython. On Monday the drink is exhausted, and
the cheese, &amp;c. is sold, frequently making, with the money presented, a
sum of &pound;50 to &pound;60. On the following Sunday, most of the company
attend the young pair to church, and the ceremony closes. Among the
eminent natives of this neighbourhood, was David ap Gwylim, of Bro
Ginin, whose works appeared in a large volume, in the year 1789. He


<span class="sidenote">A Welsh
poet.</span>


nourished from about the year 1330 to 1370. In early life he enjoyed the
munificent patronage of Ivor the generous, an ancestor of the Tredegar
family. Under the influence of a passion for the fair Morvudd he
composed 147 poems. Their loves were mutual, but her friends induced
her to accept a wealthy connection, named Rhys Gwrgan, an officer of the
English army, who served at the battle of Cressy, 1346; Dab Gwilym
persuaded Morvudd to escape with him, during the absence of her husband
in France; in consequent of which he was imprisoned, but liberated
through the influence of his friends. It is from the poems of this author,
that the modern literary dialect has chiefly been formed.</p>

hundred houses, is the picturesque bridge of Pont-y-Pain, beneath which
is a famous salmon leap; and the road leads into the luxuriant vale
of Llanwrst, in the neighbourhood of which are many seats. The principal
of these is Gwydir House, an ancient mansion of the Wynnes; and


<span class="sidenote">Gwydir

now an occasional residence of Lord Gwydir. Two miles northward is
the village of Trefrew, remarkable chiefly for a saline spring, and the site
of a royal palace, built by Llewelyn. Between two mountains, near this
place are some capital mines, the produce of which are lead, calamine,
mixed with iron, ochre, and pyrites. Bettws-y-Coed lies on the mail-coach
road to Holyhead. From Cernioge Mawr, through this place to
Ogwen Lake, a broad smooth, and well protected road has been made
among the rocky precipices with which the mountainous country abounds.
The village church contains an ancient but very perfect tomb of Gryffyd,
grand nephew of Llewellyn, the last prince of Wales. This interesting
monument is concealed rather awkwardly beneath one of the benches.</p>

<p>[C] BEVERLEY. This important market town lies at the foot of the
wolds, it was anciently called Dierwald: the wood of the Deiri; from
its extensive forest. Its present appellation may be a corruption of
Beaver ley; beavers having abounded in the neighbouring river, Hull.


<span class="sidenote">Its origin
and early
history.</span>


Its origin and early history were totally unknown, till the beginning of the
eighth century, when St. John of Beverley founded a church and monastery,
and died there. This institution was several times destroyed by the Danes;
and there is a pause in its history, till Athelstan granted to it many priviledges,
and built a new college. Many archbishops of York were benefactors
to the monastery, and expended large sums in beautifying the
church. In the early part of the civil war, Charles I. had his quarters here;
and subsequently the town was taken by the parliamentarians. It appears
that Beverley derived its first and greatest importance from its connexion
with the saint. In its present state, the town is extensive and pleasant.
The entrance from Driffield, through an ancient gateway into a spacious
street of elegant houses, is particularly beautiful. Its market-place also
being large and commodious, is a principal ornament. The church of
St. John, which is in excellent preservation, is a superb edifice, adorned
at its west end with two lofty steeples. Within it is rich in relics of
antiquity. Gisbon, describing it, says "the minster here is a very fair and
neat structure: the roof is an arch of stone. In it are several monuments
of the Earls of Northumberland, who have added a little chapel to the
choir; in the windows whereof are the pictures of several of that family,
drawn in the glass. At the upper end of the choir, on the right side of
the altar place, stands the freedstool, made of one entire stone, and said to
have been removed from Scotland; with a well of water behind it. At
the upper end of the body of the church, next the choir, hangs an
ancient tablet, with the pictures of St. John and king Athelstan, and this
distich:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15em;">
'Als free make I thee,<br />
As heart can wish, or egh can see.'"
</p>

<p>Hence, adds our author, the burgesses of Beverley pay no toll or custom
in any port or town of England. The choir is paved with marble of four
colours. Over the altar is a magnificent wooden arch supported by eight
fluted Corinthian pillars. The east window now contains all the painted
glass which could be collected from the others. The screen, between the
choir and the nave, is Gothic, and is justly esteemed a principal ornament
of the edifice. At the lower end of the body of the church stands a large
font of agate stone. In 1664, a vault was discovered of free-stone, in
which was a sheet of lead, containing the relics of St. John, with an
inscription, dated 1197, which imported that, the church having been
destroyed by fire, the ashes had been for some time lost, but that at length
they had been found and there deposited. They were contained in a small


<span class="sidenote">Ancient
superstitions.</span>


leaden box, and consisted of a few bones, six beads, some large nails, and
three brass pins. The whole was piously replaced, with an appropriate
inscription; and, in 1726, the spot was adorned with an arch of brick-work.&mdash;The
church of St. Mary is also a large and handsome structure;
and like the minster, was destroyed in 1528, by the fall of its steeple. It
contains some monuments and inscriptions; but none of note.&mdash;Beverley
is a corporate town, and is governed by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and
thirteen of the principal burgesses. The whole number of these last is about
1200; and many persons are induced to purchase their freedom, by
the privileges and immunities which it confers: among these are extensive
rights of pasture on four commons, near the town; and, as we have
observed, liberation from all tolls throughout the kingdom. Besides its
churches, Beverley has the following public edifices and charitable institutions:
the Hallgarth, a beautiful and spacious hall, in which are
held the sessions, and a register-office for deeds and wills; an elegant
market cross, supported by eight columns; each one entire piece of free-stone;
a common gaol, which was rebuilt thirty-five years since, with


<span class="sidenote">Public edifices.</span>


due attention to the suitable accommodation of its inmates; seven alms-houses
with funds, for the erection of two more; a work-house, which
cost &pound;700; and finally, an excellent free-school, to the scholars of which
are appropriated two fellowships at St. John's Cambridge, six scholarships,
and three exhibitions. The trade of Beverley arises chiefly from the
making of malt, oat-meal, and leather: formerly it was somewhat celebrated
for clothing. The vicinity of the town, particularly towards the
west, is rather pleasing; and commands several interesting prospects.
At the distance of three miles, is the moated site of Lekingfield House,
which was demolished, probably, about the end of the sixteenth century.
The barbarous custom of baiting a bull on the day of the mayor being
sworn into office, to the disgrace of the town, still continues. In the
Grammar school were educated Bishops Allcock, Fisher, and Green; and
here was painted as early as 1509, the figure of a man on horseback, by
'Hugh Goes.' Beverley is remarkable as being the birth-place of the following
eminent persons, viz.: Aluridus, an ancient historian, who died in 1129.
Dr. John Allcock, the founder of Jesus College, Oxford, who was the most
celebrated divine, scholar, and architect of his time. In 1470, he was


<span class="sidenote">Dr. John
Allcock born here.</span>


made a privy counsellor and embassador to the King of Castile. He was
successively Bishop of Rochester, Worcester, and Ely, Lord High Chancellor
of England, and lord President of Wales. In his capacity of an
architect, few, if any, ever excelled him, and his correct judgment in this
science procured him the appointment of Comptroller of the Royal Works.
He founded the Grammar School of Kingston upon Hull, and built a chapel,
on the south side of the church, where his parents were buried. The
beautiful hall of the episcopal palace of Ely was erected from his design
and at his expense. He very elegantly enlarged the parish church of
Westbury, and built that sumptuous and beautiful chapel in the Presbytery
of Ely Cathedral, where he was buried, and which remains at the present
day, a monument of his correct judgment; but all these fall into shadow,
when compared with that gorgeous and exquisite mass of enrichment,
Henry the Seventh's Chapel at Westminster; of which, if he was not the
immediate designer, he was at least the able manager and superintendant
of its erection&mdash;a monument of pious munificence that will be endeared to
every lover of art, when the living temple of its projector is forgotten.
He died at his castle of Wisbeach, October 1, 1500.&mdash;John Fisher, Bishop


<span class="sidenote">Bishop
Fisher born
here.</span>


of Rochester, was born here in 1459. His father was so eminent a
scholar and divine, that Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of
Henry VII., although unknown to him, sent for him, and appointed him
her domestic chaplain; and to his councils posterity are mainly indebted
for those magnificent foundations, St. John's and Christ's College at
Cambridge. This amiable bishop, with all his virtues, could not preserve
himself from the malignity of "the worst of England's monarchs"&mdash;Henry
VIII.; and under the pretence of being inimical to the marriage of
the king with Ann Bolyen, he was thrown into prison, and most barbarously
treated; here he continued for nearly a year, and might have been
left to die of ill treatment and old age, had it not been for the unseasonable
mark of respect paid him by Pope Paul III., who created him,
May 15, 1535, Cardinal Priest of St. Vitalis. Henry forbade the hat to
be brought into England, and sent Lord Cromwell to examine the Bishop
about the affair. "My Lord of Rochester," (says Cromwell) "what
would you say if the Pope should send you a Cardinal's hat," upon which
the Bishop replied, "Sir, I know myself to be so far unworthy of such
dignity that I think of nothing less; but if any thing should happen
assure yourself that I should improve that favour to the best advantage
that I could, by assisting the Holy Catholic Church of Christ, and in that
respect I would receive it upon my knees." When the answer was brought,
the king said in a great passion, "yea! is he yet so lusty&mdash;well, let
the Pope send him a hat when he will&mdash;mother of God! he shall wear it
on his shoulders then, for I will leave him never a head to set it on."
His ruin being now determined, but hardly daring to take his life upon
such trivial grounds, the king sent that most fawning and contemptible
creature, Sir Richard Rich, Solicitor-General, to draw from him something
that might convict him. This wiley wretch gradually drew from him a
private opinion concerning the king's supremacy, telling the Bishop at the
same time, that it was a scruple of the King's conscience that made him
ask for it. Thus entrapped he was not allowed to make a defence, but was
tried by a bill of attainder for high treason, and executed on the 22d of
the same month, and his head placed on London bridge. Thus perished
this good, but ill-fated prelate, in the 77th year of his age, which dreadful


<span class="sidenote">His head
placed on
London-bridge.</span>


tragedy, as Bishop Burnet observes, "Has left one of the greatest blots
upon this kingdom's proceedings."&mdash;The Rev. John Green was also a
native of this place, he was born in 1706, educated at the Grammar
School here, and finished his university education at St. John's College,
Cambridge, where he became master of arts; he afterwards engaged himself
as usher of a school at Litchfield, where he became acquainted with
Dr. Johnson, and Mr. Garrick. In 1730, he was elected a fellow of St.
John's College, and soon afterwards the Bishop procured for him the
vicarage of Hingeston. In 1744, Charles, Duke of Somerset, and Chancellor
of the University, made him his domestic chaplain. In June 1750, he
was elected master of Bennet College, and in 1756, Dean of Lincoln, then
Vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge; and at last, through the
influence of his patron, the Duke of Newcastle, preferred to the See of
Lincoln. He was the friend and colleague of Archbishop Secker, who had
always a just esteem for his virtues and abilities. After the death of
Lord Willoughby, of Parham, in 1765, the literary meetings of the
Royal Society used to be held in his lordship's house, as one of its most
accomplished members. In June 1761, he exerted his problematical
talents in two letters "On the Principles and Practice of the Methodists,"
which he addressed to the Rev. Mr. Berridge and Mr. Whitfield;
and to the honour of this prelate be it spoken, that when the Bill
for the Relief of the Dissenters, was brought before the House of Lords,
in May 1772, and lost upon a division of 102 to 27, he was the only
member of the clerical brotherhood, who voted in its favour. He died
suddenly at Bath, April 25, 1779. This elegant scholar was one of the
writers of the celebrated "Athenian Letters," published by the Earl of
Hardwick, in 1798, 2 vols. 4to. Beverley returns two Members to Parliament.

<p>[A] BEWCASTLE is supposed to have been a Roman station, and
garrisoned by part of the Legio Secunda Augusta, as a security to the
workmen who were employed in erecting the famous wall, it is situated in
the midst of a wild and unfrequented district, in the Ward of Eskdale.
Some vestiges of ancient buildings still remain, and numerous Roman
coins and inscriptions have been discovered here. The present name of
the village is reported to have been derived from Bueth, who was Lord of the
Manor at the time of the Conquest, and is said to have repaired a Roman
castle here, and called it after his own name. The castle was of a square
form, each front about twenty-nine yards in length: it is now in ruins:
the south side, of which there are most remains, is nearly fourteen yards
high. This structure was destroyed by the parliamentary forces in the year
1641. It seems to have been a dark gloomy fortress. Gils Bueth, the
son of Bueth, mentioned above, was treacherously killed by Robert De
Vallibus, at a meeting which had been held for friendly purposes. His
possessions then fell to the crown, and were bestowed by Henry II.
on the last Hubert de Vallibus, whose daughter conveyed them to the
family of the Multons by marriage. The estates afterwards passed through
several hands. Bewcastle in the fifth of Charles I. was granted to
Sir Robert Graham, in whose family it remains. Upon one occasion the
captain of Bewcastle is said to have made an incursion into Scotland, in
which he was defeated and forced to fly. Watt Tinlinn, a celebrated
retainer of the Buccleuch family, who held for his border service a small
tower on the frontiers of Liddisdale, pursued him. Watt Tinlinn was, by


<span class="sidenote">Anecdote of
Watt Tinlinn.</span>


profession, a cobbler, but by inclination and practice an archer, and
warrior. He closely followed the fugitive through a dangerous morass:
the captain, however, gained the firm ground; and seeing Tinlinn dismounted,
and floundering in the bog, used these words of insult: "Sutor
Watt, ye cannot sew your boots: the heels <i>risp</i>, and the seams <i>rive</i>."
"If I cannot sew," retorted Tinlinn, discharging a shaft, which nailed the
captain's thigh to his saddle. "If I cannot sew, I can yerk." Bewcastle
Church is a small edifice, standing on a rising ground near the castle, a
fosse surrounding them both. In the churchyard is a celebrated obelisk,
which has for many years attracted the attention of the curious. Its
height is fourteen feet, two inches: its breadth, on the bottom of the
broadest side, is one foot ten: on the top was originally a cross, which is
supposed to have been abolished in some ebullition of popular enthusiasm.
Various sculptured ornaments appear on its different sides, executed with
much fancy, together with an illegible Roman inscription, and some
human figures. On the wastes of Bewcastle parish, several thousands of
sheep and black cattle are annually fed. The inhabitants of the parish
live chiefly in single and scattered houses; their religious opinions are
mostly conformable to the doctrines of the church of England; but about
thirty years ago a meeting house was built for a small congregation of
Presbyterians. In this parish, a fine is paid of four years, ancient rent, on


<span class="sidenote">Ancient fine</span>


change of the Lord of the Manor by death: or of the tenants either by death
or alienation: besides various customary works and carriages; and for a
heriot, the best beast of which the tenant may die possessed, except the
riding-horse kept for the lord's service. Bewcastle parish has two schools
supported by subscription, the masters of which have a salary of about
ten pounds a year, and the privilege of a whittle-gate. The custom of
whittle-gate was formerly much observed in this and the neighbouring
counties: it consists in the master going to all the abodes of his scholars
in rotation, and being supplied with victuals by the parents or friends.</p>

<p>[A] BEWDLEY is seated on the Severn, in the centre of a populous manufacturing
district; it was, in the reign of Edward I., a manor of the Beauchamps,
and received from Edward IV. its charter of incorporation. Leland's
description of the town, and his opinion of its origin, possess some


<span class="sidenote">Leland's description
of the town.</span>


beauties, and great exactness.&mdash;"The towne selfe of Beaudley is sett on
the syde of a hill; soe comely a man cannot wish to see a towne better.
It riseth from Severne banke by east, upon the hill, by west; soe that a
man standing on the hill <i>trans pontem</i> by east, may discerne almost every
house in the towne, and at the risinge of the sunne from the east, the
whole towne glittereth (being all of a new building), as it were of gould.
By the distance of the parish church (at Ribbesford), I gather that
Beaudley is a very new towne, and that of ould time there was but some
poore hamlett, and that upon the building of a bridge there upon Severne,
and resort of people unto it, and commodity of the pleasant site, men
began to inhabit there; and because the plott of it seemed fayre to the
lookers, it hath a French name, Beaudley." The figure of the town is
that of the letter Y: the foot extending to the river; one of the horns, towards
Ribbesford, the other into the forest. The bridge, viewed from
the loaded wharfs, appears a handsome modern structure, possessing a
lightness of feature, superior even to that of the bridge at Worcester.
The church, situated at the junction of the three principal streets, is
accounted a chapel of ease to the mother church of Ribbesford; and was
rebuilt in its present neat, yet embellished style, about 1748. Here are
also appropriate places of public worship for the numerous dissenters;
several institutions for carrying on the useful work of education, mostly
supported by voluntary contributions, and a number of alms-houses for the
poor and aged. The town-hall is a handsome modern building of stone,
with three arches in front, six square pilasters, and a pediment, surmounted
by the Littelton arms, and a double row of arcades. The trade
of Bewdley is considerable, and the inhabitants boast, with reason, that
their trows and their crews are the best on the river. Among the sources
of this profitable commerce, are numerous tan-yards; manufactures of a
kind of cap, much worn before the introduction of felt hats, comb-making,
and other works in horn, and a manufacture of flannel; while
the town is a sort of mart for the wholesale grocery trade. The charter
of incorporation of Bewdley has been subject to some extraordinary
changes: the original deed, renewed by James I. was surrendered to
Charles II., and replaced by another from his successor, which last, on
the accession of Anne, was declared illegal, and became the cause of a
contention, which produced a long and expensive law-suit, ended by the


<span class="sidenote">The charter
disputed.</span>


confirmation of the original charter. By virtue of this, the corporation of
Bewdley consists of a bailiff, a recorder, a high steward, and twelve
capital burgesses, who depute one member to parliament, the bailiff being
the returning officer. The borough comprises the parish of Ribbesford
and the hamlets of Ribbenhall, Hoarstone, Blackstone, Netherton, Lower
Milton, and Lickhill; the number of burgesses are 42, and &pound;10. householders
about 484. Lord Lyttelton is lord of the manor, high steward, and
recorder. A few years since, Dr. James Johnstone, of Worcester, made
an important discovery in this neighbourhood, of a mineral spring, whose
qualities, after an attentive analysis, he declared to resemble those of the
Harrowgate and Moffat waters. The most celebrated natives of this place
were John Tombes, born in 1612, a subtle disputant, and a learned man,
but a changeling sectary; and Richard Willis, who was the son of a capper,
and became remarkable for his extemporaneous preaching; the latter
was made chaplain to King William, and promoted to the see of Winchester,
in 1714. Near a pleasant hamlet on the side of the river opposite
to Bewdley, is Spring Grove, a large white building surrounded by a


<span class="sidenote">Spring
Grove.</span>


park, late the seat of S. Skey, Esq. to whom the country is indebted for
the introduction of a breed of mules, both handsome and useful. On a
hill, half a mile from Bewdley, and on the eastern bank of the Severn, is
the elegant villa called Winterdyne. This agreeable retreat, plain in its
appearance, yet commodious, is seated on a high and romantic cliff, embowdered
in deep tufted slides, and surrounded by ornamented walks,
which are diversified with Gothic turrets, seats, and hermitages. Advancing
on the river, Blackstone rocks meet the eye; a bold range of
dusky cliffs feathered to the top, and made romantic by the formation of a
cell or hermitage, heretofore the abode of some holy man, but now a repository
for the potatoes, cheese, and farming implements of a neighbouring
agriculturist.</p>

<p>[A] BEXLEY was given by King Cenulph to the see of Canterbury. Edward
II. granted a weekly market to be held here, but this has long been
disused. Archbishop Cranmer alienated Bexley to Henry VIII. James I.
granted it to Sir John Spilman, who afterwards sold it to the celebrated
Camden, who made over his right to the University of Oxford, for the
purpose of founding an historical professorship; but covenanted that all


<span class="sidenote">One of

the revenues of the manor should be enjoyed for 99 years from his own
death, by Mr. William Heather, his heirs and successors, subject to the
payment of &pound;140. annually. The University have since granted leases
from time to time, for 21 years, to the Leighs, of Hawley. The church, a
peculiar of the Archbishops of Canterbury, has a shingled tower and
small octangular spire. On the south side of the chancel is an ancient
confessional, consisting of three divisions of pointed arches, and a recess
for holy water; on the north side are seven ancient stalls of oak with
carved heads, and other figures. Here are several curious old monuments
High-street House, which adjoins the churchyard, was rebuilt in 1701
by the late learned antiquary, John Thorpe, Esq., F.S.A., author of the
"Customale Roffense," who purchased this estate of the Austens, of Hall
Place, in 1750. On his death, his possessions devolved to his two
daughters, by Catharine, daughter of Dr. Lawrence Holker, of Gravesend:
High-street House, was allotted to the youngest, married to Cuthbert
Potts, Esq. This gentleman became owner also, in right of his wife, of a
contiguous villa, called Bourne Place, which was built about fifty years
ago, by Lawrence Holker, Esq. son of Dr. Holker. Hall Place, formerly
the seat of a family surnamed At-Hall, is an ancient and spacious edifice,
now occupied as a boarding-school. On August 12, 1822, Robert, Marquis
of Londonderry, sinking under the weight of a very heavy session of


<span class="sidenote">Death of
Lord Londonderry.</span>


Parliament, died by his own hand. Symptoms of mental aberration had
been observed in his Lordship by the Duke of Wellington, who had
required Dr. Blankhead to visit him; his Lordship severed the carotid
artery with a knife, and died almost instantly. He was an able diplomatic
character, and an acute and efficient Parliamentary leader&mdash;he was, in the
53d year of his age: on the 20th of the same month his remains were
deposited in Westminster Abbey. The Right Honourable Nicholas Vansittart
was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and raised to
the Peerage by the title of Baron Bexley, of Bexley, in Kent, on the 31st
January, 1833.</p>

<p>[A] BIBURY. In the eighth century this little village belonged to the See of
Worcester: in the twelfth century it was given, with certain restrictions, to
the Abbey of Oseney, in Oxfordshire; and, in 1547, it was finally alienated
from the See of Worcester, to the Earl of Warwick, from whom the manor
has passed through various families to Estcourt Cresswell, Esq. Bibury
is a peculiar, possessing jurisdiction over Aldsworth, Barnsley, and Winson;
the Lord of the Manor, however, claims a prescriptive right of
appointing his own official and chancellor, who hath the recording of
wills, and the granting of licenses within the peculiar: nor doth the Lord
of the Manor allow to the Bishop the right of visitation. The Church is
supposed to have been rebuilt by the monks of Oseney. The architecture
of the north and south doors is in the early Norman style. On the north
wall was a colossal painting, in fresco, of St. Christopher, the sight of
whose image, according to the monkish legends, had sufficient efficacy to


<span class="sidenote">Monkish
legends.</span>

preserve the spectator from sudden or violent death: the painting is now
obliterated. Several monuments and inscriptions to the memory of the
Coxwalls, and other families, are in the edifice. The mansion was built in
the reign of James II., by Sir Thomas Sackville, of the family of the Earls
of Dorset. From its situation on an easy eminence, it commands a fine
view of the river Colne, backed by an amphitheatre of low wood, of the
most variegated foliage, clothing the acclivities of the hills, and rendered
more beautiful from the contrast afforded by the barren downs which
appear in the distance.</p>




<p>[B] BICESTER lies in a flat situation near the eastern border of the
county. The parish is divided into two districts, termed King's End and
Market End. The church is a large and respectable edifice. There is no
peculiar manufacture: but the town derives great benefit from its market and cattle fairs.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
